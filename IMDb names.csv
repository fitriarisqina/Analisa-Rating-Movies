nm0816670,Fay Spain,Lona Fay Spain,164,"She was your typical B-movie drive-in bad girl - sometimes blonde, sometimes brunette, always bodacious. A tease, a taunter and a temptress throughout most her career, Fay Spain was born in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1932. She headed to New York where she initially found summer stock work and a bit of television exposure. One of her earliest TV appearances was not as an actress but as a contestant on the TV game show You Bet Your Life (1950) starring Groucho Marx. By 1956, this fetching starlet was winning episodic roles on the more popular shows of the day, including Perry Mason (1957), Cheyenne (1955) and Gunsmoke (1955). She was also gaining notice on the covers of magazines. This cheesecake attention led directly to her juvenile delinquent debut in Dragstrip Girl (1957) with John Ashley and Steven Terrell, where she immediately established herself as the party girl boys are willing to race cars and fight over. Other equally cheap-jack films followed with Teenage Doll (1957), Il quadrato della violenza (1957), and The Abductors (1957). Fay made an aggressive move into higher quality films with Erskine Caldwell's best-seller Il piccolo campo (1958), where she played ""Darlin' Jill"", another amoral sexpot, and as Rod Steiger's moll in Al Capone (1959), but then it was right back to Grade Z level work with The Beat Generation (1959) co-starring Mamie Van Doren, The Private Lives of Adam and Eve (1960) in which she tempts Martin Milner with the old forbidden fruit routine, and a 1962 Italian spectacle as an evil queen trying to thwart the actions of Hercules. Although Fay made some efforts to return to TV work, her career was pretty much over by the mid-60s. One of her last roles was a bit part as a mafioso matriarch in Il padrino - Parte II (1974).

A Bishop Riordan High School and University of California-Berkeley graduate, his original intention was to be a pre-med major, but that dissipated with the growing interest of acting.Joe gained experience working with a San Francisco improv group called The Wing. While at college he made his debut as Paris in a production of ""Romeo and Juliet"" in 1967 and the very next year helped founded the Berkeley Repertory Theatre, appearing in its very first first production of ""Woyzek."" He stayed with the company for 10 years and appeared in many of its plays including ""Hamlet"" and ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.""In the 1970's, Joe decided to give Hollywood a try. Playing a seductive vampire in the cult musical ""Dracula: A Musical Nightmare"" in a small LA theatre, he pursued film and TV at the same time. In between small parts on TV (""Streets of San Francisco,"" ""Lou Grant,"" ""Trapper John""), he earned bit roles as hoodlums and other assorted urban troublemaker types in such films as American Graffiti (1973) and Cielo di piombo, ispettore Callaghan (1976). He was also given the romantic cub reporter lead in the obscure supernatural horror movie Warlock Moon (1973) and, later, co-starred in the equally obscure low-budget political drama Northern Lights (1978).After his Emmy-nominated success playing junior officer Harry Goldblume on Hill Street giorno e notte (1981), Joe appeared here, there and everywhere but to somewhat less notoriety. He managed to cop recurring roles in several other series: Amazing Grace (1995), again as a detective, Murder One (1995), and as a doctor in Mercy Point (1998). He also appeared in assorted TV movies and mini-series including Emergenza nucleare (1988), Fede cieca (1990), L'estate del mio bambino (1991), the starring role in The Flood: Who Will Save Our Children? (1993), and Dalla Terra alla Luna (1998), not to mention guest parts on ""Valerie,"" ""Civil Wars,"" ""Reasonable Doubts,"" ""The X Files,"" ""Profiler,"" ""JAG,"" Nash Bridges"" and ""Touched by an Angel.""Joe made his Broadway bow in 1992 as Walter in a revival of Arthur Miller's ""The Price"" starring Eli Wallach. West coast stage credits have included ""Speed-the-Plow"" and ""American Buffalo,"" the latter earning him a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award. In films, Spano worked alongside Tom Hanks in Apollo 13 (1995) and Richard Gere and Edward Norton in Schegge di paura (1996), among others.Into the millennium, Joe returned to another recurring detective role with the hit police series New York Police Department (1993). More recently, Spano had the frequent role of FBI Special Agent Tobias Fornell in NCIS - Unità anticrimine (2003) in between featured roles in such movies as Ticker (2001), in which he played a character named Captain Spano, Sotto corte marziale (2002), Hollywoodland (2006), Il caso Thomas Crawford (2007) and Frost/Nixon - Il duello (2008)Spano and his wife Joan, a therapist, have adopted two daughters.

nm0817021,Ned Sparks,Edward Arthur Sparkman,175,"Ned Sparks proved himself a top character support whose style would be imitated for decades to come. Although less remembered now, he was an inimitable cinematic player back in 1930s Hollywood. The nasal-toned, deadpan comedian Sparks was born Edward A. Sparkman in Guelph, Canada, and was raised for a time in St. Thomas, Ontario. He attended the University of Toronto and, after a period of soul-searching, decided upon acting. He began, believe it or not, as a honky-tonk balladeer in Dawson Creek, Alaska. In 1907, he went to New York and developed his stone-faced reputation in comic outings. His first film in 1915 did not lead to other offers, particularly during a black-balling incident as a one of the founding members of Actors Equity. In 1922, his movie career headed full steam, but it was the advent of sound with Ned's cynical tones, raspy whines and sour disposition that sparked a comfortable film niche, making close to 100 films in all.

Spector graduated cum laude in 1982 with a B.A. in Professional Music from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts and went on to attend the Atlanta College of Art in Atlanta, Georgia.

She holds the distinction of being the first black homecoming queen in Santa Clara County and was one of the first black people to receive a scholarship for the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. Carol got her start in show business as a back-up singer for Bobbie Gentry at Harrah's club in Reno, Nevada. She made her film debut as a hooker in I nuovi centurioni (1972). Speed's most memorable movie roles include sassy prison inmate Mickie in Jack Hill's hilarious babes-behind-bars parody The Big Bird Cage (1972), pimp Max Julien's loyal prostitute girlfriend Lulu in the terrific Mack - Il marciapiede della violenza (1973), sarcastic rock groupie Janyce in Bummer (1973), club owner Rockne Tarkington's sweet gal pal Leslie in the fun Black Samson (1974) and deaf-mute Sarah in Al Adamson's Dynamite Brothers (1974).Carol gave an especially inspired and impressive performance as a minister's innocent wife who becomes possessed by the malevolent spirit of an evil demon in William Girdler's immensely entertaining horror flick Abby ...la storia di una donna posseduta! (1974). She had a recurring part on the daytime soap opera Il tempo della nostra vita (1965) in the summer of 1970. Moreover, she made a guest appearance on an episode of Sanford and Son (1972), has appeared in several TV commercials and pops up in the made-for-TV films The Girls of Huntington House (1973), Love Hate Love (1971), Tenafly (1973), Getting Away from It All (1972) and The Psychiatrist (1970).Outside of acting, Carol is also a successful writer (she's the author of the books ""Inside Black Hollywood"" and ""The Georgette Harvey Story""), singer and songwriter (she sings her own compositions ""I Can Make It"" in ""The Girls of Huntington House"" and ""My Soul Is A Witness"" in ""Abby""). After taking a regrettably lengthy hiatus from acting following Disco Godfather (1979) (she was slated to do a small role in Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown (1997), but backed out at the last minute), Speed made a welcome comeback with a supporting part in the independent thriller Village Vengeance (2006).Carol Speed now lives in Atlanta, Georgia.","March 14, 1945 in Bakersfield, California, USA",1945-03-14,"Bakersfield, California, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0817881,Bud Spencer,Carlo Pedersoli,195,"Bud Spencer, the popular Italian actor who starred in innumerable spaghetti Westerns and action-packed potboilers during the 1960s and 1970s, was born Carlo Pedersoli on October 31, 1929, in Naples. The first Italian to swim the 100-meter freestyle in less than a minute, Spencer competed as a swimmer on the Italian National Team at the Olympic Summer games in both Helsinki, Finland, in 1952 and Melbourne, Australia, in 1956. He was also an Olympic-class water polo player.Educated as an attorney, he was bitten by the acting bug and appeared as a member of the Praetorian Guard in his first movie, MGM's epic Quo Vadis (1951) (which was shot in Italy) in 1951. During the 1950s and first half of the 1960s he appeared in films made for the Italian market, but his career was strictly minor league until the late 1960s. He changed his screen name to ""Bud Spencer"" in 1967, as an homage to Spencer Tracy and to the American beer Budweiser. Spencer allegedly thought it was funny to call himself ""Bud"" in light of his huge frame.After the name change, Spencer achieved his greatest success in spaghetti Westerns lensed for a global audience. Teaming up with fellow Italian Terence Hill, the two made such international hits as I quattro dell'Ave Maria (1968) and Lo chiamavano Trinità... (1970) (""They Call Me Trinity""). Their dual outings made both stars famous, particularly in Europe. In all, Spencer made 18 movies with Hill.He became a jet airplane and helicopter pilot after appearing in ...Più forte ragazzi! (1972) and owned an air transportation company, Mistral Air, which he founded in 1984. However, he terminated his business interest in Mistral and entered the children's clothing industry. After 1983 Spencer's movie career slowed down, though he did have a big success in the early 1990s with the TV action-drama series ""Extralarge"". A man of many talents, Spencer wrote screenplays and texts for some of his movies. He also has registered several patents.Spencer married Maria Amato in 1960 and they have three children, Giuseppe (born 1961), Christine (1962) and Diamante (1972).In 2005 Spencer entered politics, standing as regional councillor in Lazio for the center-right Forza Italia party. He became a politician specifically at the bequest of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. According to Spencer, ""In my life, I've done everything. There are only three things I haven't been - a ballet dancer, a jockey and a politician. Given that the first two jobs are out of the question, I'll throw myself into politics.""Berlusconi, who was a media tycoon in the vein of Rupert Murdoch before he entered politics, recruited Spencer as he was ""still a major draw for the viewer, alias the voter."" Critics of Berlusconi--who tried to retain power by launching a campaign to portray his allies as the embodiment of ""good"" and the leftists of the opposition as ""evil""--was derided as an example of ""politica spettacolo"" (""showbiz politics"").Spencer announced his new career at a ""Felliniesque"" press conference at a Rome hotel, at which he hardly moved and had little to say except homilies about upholding family values. Spencer sat between two Forza Italia handlers, and according to one major Italian newspaper, ""From one moment to the next, you expected this mountain of a man to grab the heads of the two presenters and smack them together in his usual style, as he has been seen doing countless times on the big screen and television."" The audition proved to be a flop: Spencer lost the seat, and Berlusconi's party was swept from power in 2006.","October 31, 1929 in Naples, Campania, Italy",1929-10-31,"Naples, Campania, Italy","June 27, 2016 in Rome, Lazio, Italy  (natural causes)",2016-06-27,"Rome, Lazio, Italy  ",natural causes,Maria Pedersoli  (25 February 1960 - 27 June 2016) (his death) (3 children),1,0,1,3

While working in downtown Los Angeles at a landmark hotel, the leggy blond was discovered walking across the lobby's marble floor, and immediately was cast in a Placido Domingo music video. That afternoon marked the beginning of Spencer's professional career, and shortly thereafter, she landed bit parts in Trey Parker and Matt Stone's screwball comedy Baseketball and UPN's The Love Boat: The Next Wave. She hasn't stopped working since.She began serious studies with renowned acting coach Howard Fine, and through the guidance of her teacher, Spencer's talent emerged as one to watch. She has appeared in the Emmy award winning Ally McBeal, as well as NBC's daytime drama Passions and the Disney hit Even Stevens. Big screen credits include the festival award winning romantic comedy Sticky Fingers and the action-drama Johnny Caution in which she frightens audiences as the Nazi-born villain in Ed Fowler's first publicly released film.After graduating from UCLA, her outstanding abilities earned Spencer a seat in the prestigious Shakespeare program at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. There she met Nona Shepphard, who would later direct her in Acting Shakespeare New York's production of Hamlet. An avid theatre supporter, Spencer recently joined the reputable Los Angeles based West Coast Ensemble, and continues to captivate audiences, both on stage and screen, by displaying her amazing range and passion for the craft.Spencer currently resides in Los Angeles with her loyal friend, Asha, an adorable 7 pound dog she rescued from the pound.","March 9, 1979 in Los Angeles, California, USA",1979-03-09,"Los Angeles, California, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

Her longest career spell was at 20th Century Fox, from 1943 to 1963, during which time her assignments ranged from war/action movies and gothic thrillers to large-scale Biblical epics shot in CinemaScope.Testimony to the high level of competence and consistency of her work can be found in the frequency of her associations with prominent directors: Tay Garnett (Ed ora... sposiamoci (1937), Crociera d'amore (1938), Eternamente tua (1939)); John Ford (Ombre rosse (1939), Sfida infernale (1946), Uomini alla ventura (1952)); Ernst Lubitsch (Vogliamo vivere!

Arguably, the most difficult task of her lengthy career was having to pare down the 70,000 feet of film shot for the epic production of ""Cleopatra"" to 'a mere' 22,000 feet. Spencer retired in 1979.

As she got older, Spice changed the course of her career and began studying acting for stage and film. After hearing about roles for female warriors, wrestlers, and super-heroines, she took to kickboxing and bodybuilding, slowly creating a niche for herself.Spice has worked in such feature motion pictures as Star Trek V - L'ultima frontiera (1989), The Cherokee Kid (1996), Dal tramonto all'alba (1996), Guyver (1991), Soldi sporchi (1998), and Gioco d'amore (1999). She has also guest-starred on numerous TV shows including Pappa e ciccia (1988), I miei due papà (1987), Women in Prison (1987), La mamma è sempre la mamma (1983), The Bold And The Beautiful, Febbre d'amore (1973), Una bionda per papà (1991), Un genio in famiglia (1997), Un detective in corsia (1993), Buffy l'ammazzavampiri (1997), and Scrubs: Medici ai primi ferri (2001), in what she terms as an ""action actress."" ""In fact,"" says Spice, ""I can't remember doing a role where I wasn't asked to perform some kind of physical feat"". Since 1986, Spice has been stunt doubling Deidre Hall (Marlena) on Il tempo della nostra vita (1965) and has also played several roles on that soap. She had the great honor of working with Clint Eastwood on Million Dollar Baby (2004), and then had a blast working on an independent film in with Luke Goss, called The Dead Undead (2010). She is very proud of co-starring in an incredible film called The Sensei (2008) with Diana Lee Inosanto starring & directing, a fun film called Bare Knuckles (2010), and recently, she played a warden in a Stallone film, and can be seen as a hooker on the new TV show Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013). Starting in 2014, Spice has produced her own show called I Fight for My Life (2014), about women victims and turning them into women victors!Stunts came into play in 1980 ago when Spice was asked to double an actress playing a Judo instructor opposite Rock Hudson. Since then, she has doubled for the likes of Louise Fletcher, Meg Foster, Katherine Ross, Clare Carey, Deidre Hall, Cindy Pickett, Linda Kozlowski, Eileen Brennen, Becky Ann Baker, Kelly Preston and many more. Spice also Stunt Coordinates feature films, Television shows and commercials. Her stunt expertise is in fighting & ""hitting the ground!""Although Spice has crashed cars, dove through glass windows, taken stair falls, executed 30-foot ratchets, 50-foot high falls, and hung from helicopters 350 feet above the ground, she is perhaps best known for her ability to pick a 300 pound man up over her head in a fireman's carry.Gracing the cover and pages of over 100 magazines, both here and abroad, Spice has also made a name for herself as a nutritional expert with 2 Masters in Fitness Science & Holistic Nutrition and a PhD in Natural Health Medicine, writing for magazine as Ms. Fitness, Natural Muscle Magazine, and World Black Belt. She holds a 3rd DAN in Arjukanpo, 1st DAN in Doce Pares Eskrima, and is Certified Level B in Israeli Krav Panim el Panim (abbrev.

Her successful joint venture with her husband -- a popular line of vegetarian food products called ""Spice Of Life Meatless Meats & Jerky."" In December of 1998, she was voted into the Marquis Who's Who in America-West. One of her greatest honors was posing for a 30ft bronze statue where she represents the past, present and future female athletes of the Olympics. Spice's goal is to continue to set an example for the ""women of the new millennium"" -- spiritually focused, mentally alert, and physically capable. Spice is married to Gregory Crosby, screenwriter (Hacksaw Ridge), grandson of actor/singer Bing Crosby, and they have a beautiful son Luke, who is equally healthy and active!","April 26, 1952 in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA",1952-04-26,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA",,,,,Gregory Crosby  (26 August 1989 - present) (1 child),1,0,1,1

nm0818598,Ed Spielman,Ed Spielman,,"Ed Spielman - Creator Kung Fu ABC-TV SeriesEd Spielman is a Writer, Executive Producer for Television and Motion Pictures, an Author and Journalist. He is the Creator of the groundbreaking and Emmy Award winning classic 'KUNG FU' ABC television series which initially aired on ABC from 1972 to 1975 and starred David Carradine as the Asian-American Shaolin monk from the Far East who journeyed through the Old West.The show's original Pilot (co-written with Howard Friedlander), debuting February 22, 1972 on ABC's popular Movie of the Week was ""the first American Martial Arts film"". The Emmy award winning series that followed originated the modern martial arts genre for television and motion pictures and was honored by Entertainment Weekly magazine as ""One of the 100 Best Television Shows of All Time.""Early Life Ed Spielman was born on Feb 3, 1944 to Harriet (Shapiro) and Al Spielman, into a working class Jewish family in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Hungary, White Russia and Poland. He has one brother Howard, eighteen months older; the Spielman brothers would have a close and lifelong association not only in age, but also in creativity. The family soon moved to the Midwood section of Flatbush, Brooklyn. Ed's parents divorced when he was twelve and his mother worked very hard to provide for her sons.Ed began his career at a young age and in an unlikely fashion, when his fifth grade public school teacher assigned the class to ""write a short story."" ""That was the first thing I ever wrote,"" Ed recalls. He was taken aback when he received the lowest mark in the class: a zero. The teacher demanded a note from his mother, railing, ""You didn't write this. Your Mother wrote this!"" ""That was my first literary effort,"" he laughs today in recalling the incident. ""My mother had not even seen it, let alone written it. I always wanted to find that teacher and show her my Life Membership Card in The Writers Guild...and thank her for a good review."" Ed skipped the eighth grade and entered Brooklyn College at the age of sixteen. He attended at night while working as a Page on day-time quiz shows at ABC-TV in New York. With his friend and fellow Page, Howard Friedlander, he took to writing screenplays. Spielman discovered Kung Fu in the early 1960s and studied Mandarin Chinese, being one of only five students in the Chinese language dept. of Brooklyn college. He spent years doing research in New York's Chinatown and elsewhere, unearthing this heretofore secret knowledge. At that time, kung fu was little known in the Western world and was denied to non-Chinese. It was taught by master/student relationships and within families. It was never revealed to non-Chinese.But Spielman pressed on. By the mid-1960s, Ed had acquired a depth of information and wrote a forty-four-page treatment for film, TV and publishing titled, Kung-Fu: The Way of the Tiger, The Sign of the Dragon. He spent the next few years trying to move it forward to film or television.In 1969, he was introduced to young agent Peter Lampack at the William Morris Agency in New York. Lampack liked the material and made a deal with Fred Weintraub, Warner Bros. Executive Vice President in New York. In February of 1970, Lampack arranged a deal for Spielman and Friedlander to write a theatrical motion picture screenplay from Spielman's original story. All of this transpired in New York. (Peter Lampack would later establish the prestigious Peter Lampack Literary Agency which represents many renowned writers, among them Clive Cussler).At the end of this development of Kung Fu, Warner Bros. chose not to make the theatrical film, but Fred Weintraub and studio executive Harvey Frand had faith in the project. They took it to ABC, which by that time had introduced a pioneering Movie of the Week format. The Spielman/Friedlander script was pared down for budget, produced and placed on the air, Television had never before seen anything like this 'eastern-western'... and it was an immediate hit. The iconic Kung Fu monthly-then-weekly series followed.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0818765,Mickey Spillane,Frank Morrison Spillane,,"Mickey Spillane, the king of the pulp novelists in the post-WW II period, sold an estimated 200 million copies globally. He was born Frank Morrison Spillane in Brooklyn, New York. Young Frank's mother was a Protestant who bestowed on him his middle name ""Morrison"", but his Irish Catholic father, barkeep John Joseph Spillane, allegedly had his son baptized with the middle name ""Michael"", a traditional name for Irishmen (so common, in fact, that the nickname derived from it, ""Mick"", served as a derogatory term for Irishmen in both the US and England). ""Women liked the name Mickey"", Spillane said, explaining why he chose the moniker that eventually became one of the world's best-selling novelists. In 1980 seven of the top 15 all-time bestselling fiction books published in the U.S. had been written by Spillane.Despite the fact that his books were international bestsellers, as a writer Spillane was almost universally reviled by literary critics. He and his novels were attacked not only for their alleged illiteracy but were denounced by the U.S. Senate's Kefauver Commission as promoting juvenile delinquency. Explaining the extraordinary appeal of his novels, Spillane simply said, ""People like them."" He countered his critics by saying they were jealous of his success. ""I'm a writer, not an author,"" was Spillane's mantra all through his literary life. ""The difference is a writer makes money."" As late as 1999 Spillane told an audience at London's National Film Theatre, ""Authors write, writers get paid."" When he was asked about his literary influences, Spillane replied, ""Dollars"".Spillane was brought up in the grimy industrial town of Elizabeth, NJ, in what he described as a ""very tough"" neighborhood. His mother provided him with balance inside the confines of the home, where he became a voracious reader, devouring all of the works of Alexandre Dumas and Herman Melville by the time he was 11 years old. While still a high school student, he ""went professional"" at the age of 14, writing for the Elizabeth Daily Journal. In 1935 he began submitting his work to magazines before aiming lower and learning his craft by writing for comic books, including such popular titles as ""Batman"", ""Captain Marvel"", ""Captain America"" and ""Superman"". ""[It was] a great training ground for writers,"" Spillane explained. ""You couldn't beat it.""After high school Spillane went to Kansas State College on a football scholarship before dropping out. He joined the Army Air Corps the day after Pearl Harbor, but never left the US, spending the war years flying fighter planes and teaching air cadets how to fly. Still a civil pilot after the war, Spillane claimed he had put in 11,000 hours in the air by 1999. In 1945 he married Mary Ann Pearce, the first of his three wives. The couple had two sons and two daughters.After leaving the military, he briefly worked in the Barnum and Bailey Circus as a trampoline artist and adept knife-thrower. Subsequently he worked for the FBI as an undercover operative to crack a narcotics ring (the subject of the novel ""Kiss Me, Deadly"", not the atomic bomb plot of the movie). He claimed in interviews that he had been shot twice and had been knifed once. Eventually he went back to writing.Influenced by Carroll John Daly, the pulp writer who created the seminal private eye Race Williams, Spillane made the P.I. genre his own. His work was in the vein of the ""hard-boiled"" Black Mask school of pulp fiction of the 1930s. As a pulp writer, Spillane's mantra was ""violence will outsell sex every time."" By combining them he created a formula for success that begat a book publishing phenomenon.Spillane's innovation was to inject gory violence into P.I. stories for a generation of 16 million men who had just been through the most violent war in history. After the war, the popularity of slick magazines was eroding due to the booming market in paperbacks, pulp fiction that sold for 25 cents a copy. These new mass-market novels featured lurid covers that would attract a customer at what became the ubiquitous steel-wire racks filled with paperbacks that sprouted up at bus stations, lunch counters, shops and newsstands all over the world.Spillane's style was perfect for the new post-war fiction market. He attributed his success to Roscoe Fawcett of Fawcett Gold Medal Books, who envisioned a market for original novels instead of the reprints of classic works that dominated the paperback market during World War II. Gold Medal started to market novels written directly for paperback, and by injecting gore into the PI genre, both Fawcett and Spillane won a gold medal for their staggering sales.Second wife Sherri Malinou was a model who Spillane noticed when she was featured on the cover of one of his books.Raymond Chandler said of Spillane, ""Pulp writing at its worst was never as bad as this stuff."" Spillane's books always featured a great hook in the opening pages, as he believed that ""the first page sells the book"". His narratives are first-person spoken monologues, directly addressed to the reader. Hammer is less a detective in the guise of Dashiell Hammett's Continental Op or Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe than he is a vigilante, always ready to partake in a bit of the old ultra-violence.Spillane published his first Mike Hammer pulp, the infamous ""I, the Jury', in 1947. Written in nine days, the book introduces Hammer as a tough-talking, hard-drinking bruiser.Other Hammer books with the same formula of murderous mugs and even more dangerous, double-crossing malevolent dames followed: ""Vengeance in Mine"" (1950), ""My Gun is Quick"" (1950), ""The Big Kill"" (1951), and ""Kiss Me, Deadly"" (1952). Hammer was not only a two-fisted he-man, but each of those mailed fists typically clutched a large-caliber automatic. No dainty .32 Colts--the pistol of choice for the sophisticated detectives of the '20s and '30s--for Mike Hammer. His hirsute ham-fist sported a .45 ACP, the service pistol of the GI generation.Mike Hammer was a true bellwether of the times, for rather than just go after criminals or garden-variety gangsters like self-respecting operatives of the '30s, he went after ""Reds"" and ""Commies"", the nation's bogeymen, and women who were stealing atomic secrets, adulterating Hollywood films with Red propaganda. In the potboiler ""One Lonely Night"" (1951), hammer wields a ""Chicago typewriter"" - a submachine gun - to tap out one-way tickets to heaven for 40 Commie heavies and fellow-travelers.Though he eschewed politics in real life, he regarded himself as a patriot and was admired by prominent right-wingers for his anti-Communist stand. Novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand extolled Spillane, while movie cowboy John Wayne gave him a Jaguar XK140 roadster in 1956, a car he still had a half-century later (and in top working order). While Cold War critics often tried to make a link between Spillane and notorious Red-baiter Sen. Joseph McCarthy, when asked in 1999 if he approved of what McCarthy had done, Spillane replied, ""McCarthy was a nit-head. He didn't know what was going on. He was a slob.""Spillane stopped writing for nearly a decade after converting to the Jehoavah's Witnesses in 1952. At this point he didn't need to write, as the royalties from the millions of copies of his books earned him a substantial income. In 1961 he returned to writing with ""The Deep"", arguably the best of the Mike Hammer novels. With the ""Day of the Guns"" in 1964 Spillane created a new series featuring secret agent Tiger Mann, a globetrotting spy who was America's answer to James Bond. Like Hammer, Mann was anti-Communist in the extreme and wiped out Reds with relish during the Cold War years of the 1960s. However, during Spillane's absence during the 50s, Ian Fleming (whom Spillane dismissed as ""a gourmet"") and other writers had stolen his thunder: the Tiger Mann series and Spillane's other non-series novels did not enjoy the vast sales of the '50s. The second part of Spillane's formula - sex - had lost its steam in the 1960s, after the collapse of censorship led to a proliferation of raw pornography and the availability of much more graphic, though serious, novels for the more thoughtful reader.The Hammer novels did well in the visual media: there were two television series and multiple movies. The only distinguished film made from Spillane's works was Robert Aldrich's late noir Un bacio e una pistola (1955), now a cult classic. Spillane hated the film, which transmogrified the narcotics dealer plot of the novel into the theft of an atomic bomb (a true Cold War plot), which he found ludicrous.Spillane took another hiatus from writing novels between 1973 and 1989, although he did write at two well-reviewed children's books, ""The Day the Sea Rolled Back"" (1979) and ""The Ship That Never Was"" (1982). He wrote the novels from the point of view of a child, he said, which explained their success. Though no longer a best-selling author, Spillane retained his fame during the 1970s due to his appearances in Miller Lite beer TV commercials. Although not a teetotaler, Spillane did not drink much, preferring an occasional beer over hard liquor, and he never smoked. He revived the Hammer franchise with ""The Killing Man"" in 1989, but Spillane, now in his 70s, was not a big seller.

nm0818874,Joe Spinell,Joseph J. Spagnuolo,180,"Joseph J. Spagnuolo was born on October 28, 1936 in Manhattan, New York City at his family's apartment on 2nd Avenue. Spinell was a tough guy on and off the screen all his life. During his teen years, while still in high school, he acted in various plays on the New York stage, on and off Broadway, eventually earning a place in Joe Papp's Shakespeare Festival Theater. In 1960, he parlayed his stage work into a performing contract for MGM, where it was suggested that he change his name to Joe Spinell to make his name easier to pronounce. For nine years, Spinell worked with the group, which was also known as the Theater of the Forgotten, which also put on plays in prisons for the inmates. His minimal salary for his stage work forced him to hold down other jobs to make ends meet. Those jobs included working as a taxi driver, a post office clerk, and a liquor store clerk during Christmas holidays.In 1972, Spinell was originally noticed when he appeared in his first movie role, a small, uncredited speaking part in The Godfather (1972), the right film for a tough, mean-looking Italian with a New York City accent. After his success, he became a familiar character actor who appeared in violent urban movies where he was usually cast as vicious thugs or seedy gang leaders. In both Godfather movies he played the hit man Willy Cici. In Rocky (1976), the first of several films he made with Sylvester Stallone, he played the loan shark Gazzo who employs Rocky as a collector.His best (or worst) or most disgusting role is probably the one for which he is best remembered: the rare starring role of Frank Zito in Maniac (1980), a serial killer who kills women and uses their scalps to dress up female mannequins he keeps in his apartment. After Maniac (1980), Spinell continued acting with big-name Hollywood and independent movie directors, usually playing villainous thugs in small to medium roles.During the last years of his life, Spinell's choice of projects became increasingly suspect; for example, imprisoned serial killer John Wayne Gacy wanted Spinell to play him in a movie. But with Maniac (1980) still on his mind, Spinell always wanted to do a sequel to the movie and with New York filmmaker Buddy Giovinazzo, they shot a 10-minute promo reel in 1986 titled Mr. Robbie, which was to be the sequel for Maniac (1980). After a few years of hard work and searching, Spinell found financing for the sequel, though just as pre-production was to begin, Joe Spinell suddenly passed away in his apartment in Sunnyside, Queens, New York on January 13, 1989, at age 52, due to undetermined causes, still the subject of much speculation. Some say he died of a heart attack because of his failing health in recent months due to his heavy drinking, drug use, and the emotional turmoil resulting from his mother's death in 1987. Others say he died from an asthma attack, or that he bled to death from an accidental (or deliberate) cut since he was a hemophiliac.Spinnel left behind an impressive body of film work all of which stand as a testament to his talent and unique screen presence as a character actor. He is survived by an ex-wife, a daughter, two brothers and a sister.","October 28, 1936 in New York City, New York, USA",1936-10-28,"New York City, New York, USA","January 13, 1989 in New York City, New York, USA  (heart attack)",1989-01-13,"New York City, New York, USA  ",heart attack,Jean Jennings  (28 September 1977 - 1979) (divorced) (1 child),1,1,1,1

Colonel in the Australian Army. His maternal grandparents were English, and his father was of English and some Scottish descent. Rick spent his childhood on various army bases in Australia and Britain. As a teenager, he fronted many music bands, such as the ""Jordy Boys"", ""Wakedy Wak"", and ""Zoot"". The latter was his most successful, paving his way for future success as a musician. He came to the U.S. early 1970s, and recorded an album, Beginnings. It had one ""major"" hit - Speak to The Sky. After that came ""Comic Book Heroes"", which was marginally successful.He learned to speak English with an American accent to further his acting career, after he lost his record label. While he waited for his big break, he signed a contract with Universal television, playing bit parts in shows such as L'uomo da sei milioni di dollari (1974) and Agenzia Rockford (1974). He also had a recurring role on the soap Febbre d'amore (1973). In the early 1980s, his luck changed as he signed to RCA Records and was then cast as ""Dr. Noah Drake"" on the soap General Hospital (1963). While he had released six albums in the 1970s, his 1980 break-through album ""Working Class Dog"" gave him the #1 single ""Jessie's Girl"". From the music and TV exposure, he became a teen idol. He continued to star on ""GH"" while touring and releasing ""Success Hasn't Spoiled Me Yet"", with the hit ""Don't Talk To Strangers"". Upon releasing his 3rd album with RCA-""Living In Oz"" he quit ""GH"" and went back to his rock roots. ""Living In Oz"" is considered by many his finest (and hardest rock) album. He starred in the movie Una rockstar in cerca d'amore (1984) in 1984 and released the soundtrack to it with the hit ""Love Somebody"", followed by ""Don't Walk Away"" and ""Bop Til Ya Drop"". His next album, ""Tao"", started his slow descent from rock star status. It was followed up in 1988 by ""Rock Of Life"" which was his 'moodiest' and least recognized album (by the public).In 2015, Rick received positive notices playing Meryl Streep's character's boyfriend in Dove eravamo rimasti (2015).","August 23, 1949 in Guildford, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",1949-08-23,"Guildford, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",,,,,Barbara Porter  (27 October 1984 - present) (2 children),1,0,1,2

nm0819803,Bruce Springsteen,Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen,175,"Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born September 23, 1949 in Long Branch, New Jersey, USA. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, worked as a bus driver, and was of Irish and Dutch ancestry. His mother, Adele Ann (Zerilli), worked as a legal secretary, and was of Italian descent. He has an older sister, Virginia, and a younger sister Pamela Springsteen. Bruce was raised as a Catholic. He was inspired to take up music when he, at the age of seven, saw Elvis Presley on Toast of the Town (1948). When he was thirteen he bought his first guitar for 18 dollars. His mother took out a loan when Bruce was 16 and bought him a Kent guitar for 60 dollars.In 1965, he became the lead guitarist in the band ""The Castiles"", he would later become lead singer in the band. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township, New Jersey. From 1969 to 1971 he performed with Steven Van Zandt, Danny Federici and Vini ""Mad Dog"" Lopez in a band called ""Child"", that was renamed later to ""Steel Mill"" when guitarist Robbin Thompson joined the band.In 1972, he signed a record deal with Columbia Records and released his debut album, ""Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J."", with his New Jersey-based colleagues, who would later be called ""The E Street Band"", In January, 1973. The album had critical success and so did their second album, ""The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle"", released in September, 1973, but had little commercial success. In 1975, after more than 14 month of recording, their third album was released, ""Born to Run"", which had both critical and commercial success for Springsteen and the band.In 1977, he returned to the studio, after a two-year legal battle with former manager Mike Appel, and produced the album, ""Darkness on the Edge of Town"", released in 1978 and became a turning point musically for his career. In 1980 came the release of ""The River"", the album sold well and he followed up with the album ""Nebraska"" which had critical success but had little commercial success. Springsteen came back with a bang with the release of the album ""Born in the U.S.A."" in 1984, which sold 15 million copies in the U.S. alone and had seven top ten singles. It became one of the best-selling albums of all time.After the huge success of the ""Born in the U.S.A."" album he released a more calm and sedate album in 1987, ""Tunnel of Love"", which included songs about love lost and the challenges of love, after the break-up with first wife, Julianne Phillips. The albums released in 1992, ""Lucky Town"" and ""Human Touch"" were also popular, Human Touch being the most popular of the two, hitting the number one spot of the best-selling albums in the UK. In 1994 he won an academy award for the song ""Streets of Philadelphia"" featured in the film Philadelphia (1993).In 1995, he released the album ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"", which was mostly a solo guitar album and was inspired by ""Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass,"" a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Dale Maharidge. After being apart from the E Street Band for several years they reunited with a successful tour which ended in Madison Square Garden in New York in the year 2000. In 2002 he released the first studio album with the full band in over 18 years, ""The Rising"", and it became a critical and commercial success. In 2005 he released his third folk album (after ""Nebraska"" and ""The Ghost of Tom Joad""), ""Devils & Dust"" It was followed by ""We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions"" in 2006 and ""Magic"" in 2007. His 16th album will be released on January 27, 2009 and is called ""Working on a Dream"".He married for the first time at the age of 35 to actress Julianne Phillips. The marriage helped boost her acting career, but his traveling took it's toll on the marriage and the final blow came when she found out his affair with the American singer/songwriter/guitarist Patti Scialfa. Their marriage ended in 1989. He then married Patti Scialfa on June 8th, 1991, They had lived together since the separation between him and his first wife and they had a child before they married.

When she got older, she became a still photographer and photographed the pictures for his record singles. During the early 80s, she decided to take up acting like her brother's first wife, Julianne Phillips, did during the mid-80s and she had a small role in her first film playing a young cheerleader named ""Dina Phillips"" in the cult teen comedy classic Fuori di testa (1982), and got some brief exposure, as it launched many other future celebrities in the film like Forest Whitaker, Nicolas Cage and James Russo.

nm0819810,Annie Sprinkle,Ellen Steinberg,,"Annie Sprinkle was born Ellen F. Steinberg on July 23, 1954, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A self-described ""nice Jewish girl"" whose parents were academics, she grew up in the greater Los Angeles area, and was a bashful girl well into her teens. Of her youth, Annie has said, ""I was not a sexual child. I was very shy and inhibited. It wasn't until I lost my virginity at the age of 17 that I even became interested in sex."" However, once she surrendered her maidenhead, sex was her lifelong concern, becoming a means of expression, then an art form, and finally a venue for exploring spirituality, First, however, it was a living.The 1960s and early 1970s were times of rebellion, and rebel against her middle-class roots young Ellen did, becoming a prostitute. Her entry into adult entertainment came while she was employed as a cashier at a porn theater. Viewing the movie on the screen fueled her curiosity about what it must be like to be filmed while making love. Initially she worked a variety of behind-the-camera jobs before making her debut as a hardcore-sex actress in Teenage Cover Girls (1976). While the re-christened Annie Sprinkle was never a superstar in adult entertainment, she enjoys the distinction of being one of the few actresses to be denounced by name from the floor of the U.S. Senate. Annie Sprinkle had used hardcore films as a springboard for a much richer, sex-positive career as an author, a lecturer/sex educator and a performance artist.Ultimately, she appeared in approximately 200 porn loops, shorts and feature films. Her niche was the fetish genre catering to paraphillias. In the early 1980s Sprinkle--a feminist--began exerting more control over her projects in her evolution from porn performer to artist. Before setting out on the next phase of her creative life, Sprinkle wrote and directed her first hardcore feature, Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle (1981), which became the #2 top-grossing adult film of 1982. While it was not much different from mainstream porn in terms of style, audiences responded to Sprinkle's warm and playful persona. From the ""nice Jewish girl"" of her teens, she had evolved into the Jewish mother of porn.The openly bisexual Annie (she lives with her life-partner Elizabeth Stephens, a lecturer at UC Santa Cruz) describes herself as a ""Post-Porn Modernist"" and promotes her own conception of a pansexual, spiritual female sexuality. The maturation of Dr. Sprinkle (she received a PhD in human sexuality) as an artist and as a person led her to leave the porn industry to fulfill her artistic pursuits as a performance artist, filmmaker, and writer, creating art and cultural artifacts that promote healthy attitudes toward sexuality and women.Annie Sprinkle, the artist and sexual shaman, challenges the repressive trends that are omnipresent in American culture, which has brought her not only into conflict with the anti-sex, pro-censorship wing of the feminist movement )the likes of Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon) right-wing religious fringe. Jesse Helms, the famously reactionary senator who got his start delivering political commentary on a North Carolina TV station in the days of the Fariness in Broadcasting standard, denounced her live performance art piece in the Senate during the debate over the National Endowment for the Arts. Her performance piece, which had received federal funding, entails inviting audience members to view her cervix with a speculum and flashlight in order to ""demystify the female body."" Helms denounced her performance piece as pornography, which is besides the point.For Annie Sprinkle, non-misogynistic pornography can be a sex-positive vehicle for banning shame and ignorance while promoting pleasure and feminism. She remains committed to spreading the good news of her pro-sex message, as joyously as possible, that sex should be liberating, fun, free of shame and repression, and infused with creativity, love and spirituality.","July 23, 1954 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA",1954-07-23,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA",,,,,Beth Stephens  (? - ?),1,0,0,0

Vandalia had served as the state capital of Illinois for two decades (1819-1839), but it has remained a small city since the capital was transferred to Springfield, Illinois. Internationally, its main claim of fame is being a setting for the novel ""An Antarctic Mystery"" (1897) by Jules Verne, in which the protagonist is from Vandalia.Squibb's parents were Lewis Squibb (1905-1996) and his wife JoyBelle Force; (1905-1996). Lewis was an obscure figure, who worked as an insurance agent. During World War II, Lewis served in the United States Navy. JoyBelle was a well-known pianist, who provided accompanying music for silent films during the 1920s. Joybelle won the World Championship Old Time Piano Playing Contest twice, in 1975 and 1976.Squibb started her career as a theatrical actor, working with the Cleveland Play House. The Play House is a professional regional theater company located in Cleveland, Ohio. Squibb received additional acting lessons from the HB Studio (Herbert Berghof Studio) in Greenwhich Village, New York City. The studio was led at the time by acting teachers Herbert Berghof (1909-1990) and Uta Hagen (1919-2004).By 1958, Squibb started performing regularly at Off-Broadway theaters in Manhattan, New York City. They had a seating capacity ranging from a 100 to 499 viewers, In 1960, Squibb made her Broadway debut in a production of the musical play ""Gypsy"" (1959) by Arthur Laurents (1917-2011). The play was loosely based on the autobiography of striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee (1911-1970). Squibb was cast in the role of Electra, a fellow striptease artist.While continuing her acting career through the 1960s, Squibb also worked as a model for romance novel and as a character actor for commercials.In 1990, the 61-year-old Squibb made her film debut in the romantic fantasy ""Alice"". During the 1990s, Squibb regularly appeared in small roles in various theatrical films. Among them were the drama film ""Scent of a Woman"" (1992), the historical drama ""The Age of Innocence"" (1993), the romantic comedy ""In & Out"" (1997), and the romantic fantasy ""Meet Joe Black"" (1998).In 2002, Squibb had a more memorable role in the comedy-drama film ""About Schmidt"" , cast in the role of Helen Schmidt. In the film, Helen is the wife of protagonist Warren Schmidt (played by Jack Nicholson). They have been long alienated from each other, while still living together by force of habit. After Warren's mandatory retirement from a life insurance company, they plan to travel together in a motor home but Helen suddenly dies from a blood clot in her brain. The film deals with Warren's frustration and loneliness, following the ends of both his career and his marriage. And his reaction when he finds out from old love letters that Helen had an extramarital affair during their marriage.","November 6, 1929 in Vandalia, Illinois, USA",1929-11-06,"Vandalia, Illinois, USA",,,,,"Edward Leon Sostek  (1953 - 1959) (divorced)

nm0820409,Michael St. Angel,Michael St. Angel,185,"Second lead and featured actor Michael St. Angel was born in Rockford, Illinois in 1916, the son of prominent business man Jasper St. Angel. Following high school the darkly handsome youth attended Wisconsin's Beloit College majoring in drama, then later transferred to Iowa's St. Ambrose College where he became a drama teacher after receiving his degree.Deciding to pursue acting professionally, he left his teaching post after only a couple of years and returned to Wisconsin where he joined up with the Belfry Players and traveled the country in stock shows. He eventually made it to New York and in July of 1942 made his Broadway debut in the small role of a soldier in ""The Cat Screams"". The show closed four days later. Two months later he was cast in the much more successful comedy ""Janie,"" which ran well over a year.A Warner Bros. talent scout picked up on Michael's dark, wavy-haired good looks and convinced him to travel West to audition for the lead role of George Gershwin in the biopic Rapsodia in blu (1945). The part went to Robert Alda, however, and he was about to return to NY when a meeting with RKO Studios resulted in a contract.Michael started out inauspiciously in tiny parts starting out with the film Viaggio per la libertà (1943). Following a couple of other obscure bits, he secured more visible roles in Le sorprese dell'amore (1944) and L'azione continua (1944), which led to the romantic co-starring role opposite Elaine Riley in the Leon Errol comedy starrer What a Blonde (1945). Michael showed enough promise from this to be cast as the second lead role in the thriller Lo strangolatore di Brighton (1945) which toplines John Loder as an actor dangerously obsessed by the title role he plays on stage.Michael married Fox singer/dancer Marjorie Holliday in 1945. After the birth of their son Jasper Michael, Jr. in 1951, she abandoned her career for family obligations. But Michael's film career already went into a steep decline as quickly as it peaked. Before he knew it, he found himself back to minor roles in such films as First Yank Into Tokyo (1945), Nessuno ti avrà mai (1946) and The Truth About Murder (1946). Over his objections, RKO changed his marquee name to ""Steven Flagg"" to give his career a boost but little changed. Under this name he found work with former co-star Leon Errol in several of the star's short films. Producer Howard Hughes kept Michael under contract despite his lack of stature and following a few parts in such films as Il gigante di New York (1949), I diavoli alati (1951), The Pace That Thrills (1952) and La linea francese (1953), he was dropped.Quickly switching his stage name back to his real name, Michael moved more and more towards TV work. One very promising opportunity in 1957 to star as TV detective Mike Hammer fell through. Outside of acting, to make ends meet Michael worked for producer Howard Hughes over at TWA at one point and also served as a personal assistant to his old friend, columnist Walter Winchell. Finally, in 1959, Michael went into business for himself, opening his first restaurant.In the next couple of decades only occasional small acting roles came his way both on film (Che fine ha fatto Baby Jane? (1962), I 4 del Texas (1963), Alle donne piace ladro (1966), La macchina dell'amore (1971)) and TV (""The Gale Storm Show,"" ""The Untouchables,"" ""The Virginian,"" ""Love, American Style,"" ""The Magician"").Following wife Marjorie's sudden death at age 48 in 1959 of a cerebral hemorrhage, Michael ventured on in the restaurant business as manager of his last eatery, Michael's Los Feliz. He died in 1984 at age 67 at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital survived by his son.","October 9, 1916 in Rockford, Illinois, USA",1916-10-09,"Rockford, Illinois, USA","January 13, 1984 in Los Angeles, California, USA",1984-01-13,"Los Angeles, California, USA",,Marjorie Holliday  (1945 - 21 December 1969) (her death) (1 child),1,0,1,1

After service in World War I, he returned to the film business, this time as a director alternating between Fox and Mack Sennett. He proved to have a talent for slapstick farce, as well as for elegant domestic comedy, but could also handle action films. Moreover, when the occasion demanded, he was able to keep a tight reign on some of Hollywood's more temperamental movie queens: Pola Negri in A Woman of the World (1925), Clara Bow in È arrivata la squadra (1928), Joan Crawford in Un marito fuori posto (1930), and others.His most fruitful collaborations were with Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton in the 1920s. One of his best films with Keaton was Saltarello e il suo delitto (1921), a break-neck farce based on mistaken identity. He also produced the hit social comedies Are Parents People? (1925) and The Grand Duchess and the Waiter (1926). Of the latter, Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times (2/9/26) commented that ""dull moments"" were ""conspicuous by their absence"". Mal directed an early version of I signori preferiscono le bionde (1928), but no copies of this film are known to have survived. One of his notable non-comedic efforts was the Philo Vance mystery La Canarina Assassinata (1929), which starred William Powell, Jean Arthur and Lupe Velez, and which won critical plaudits for the director. The New York Times commented (March 11,1929) ""his flashes of the canary swinging on a trapeze in a theatre are so excellent that they bring to mind the photographic feats in Variety"".St. Clair's career began to falter with the advent of sound, but was somewhat reinvigorated with the all-star Hollywood Cavalcade (1939), for which he directed the Keystone Kops chase sequences. Between 1943 and 1945 he presided over four Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy features when the team left Roach and MGM for 20th Century-Fox, but the studio's attempt to revive the great slapstick comedies of the 1920s was spectacularly unsuccessful. After that his output declined somewhat, except for a few minor films he made for Sol M. Wurtzel's B-unit.At 6'3"" (some accounts say 6'7""), St. Clair had the distinction of being known as ""the tallest director in Hollywood"".","May 17, 1897 in Los Angeles, California, USA",1897-05-17,"Los Angeles, California, USA","June 1, 1952 in Pasadena, California, USA  (after a lengthy illness)",1952-06-01,"Pasadena, California, USA  ",after a lengthy illness,"Margaret Murray Holt  (6 February 1937 - 1 June 1952) (his death)

Lili actually took the stripper out of burlesque and put her squarely on the Las Vegas stage. She was also noted for her pin-up photography, especially for photos taken by Bernard of Hollywood. She was married and divorced six times, including small-time actors Paul Valentine and Ted Jordan and well-known restaurateur Armando Orsini. Born Willis Marie Van Schaack on June 3, 1918, the Minneapolis-born entertainer's early life remains somewhat of a mystery. She was raised by her grandparents and had two sisters that went into show biz. Trained in ballet, Lili started out as a chorine at such notable places as the Florentine Gardens. She went on to develop and choreograph her own solo act while featuring herself in the nude. Lili's bare-all debut, at the Music Box, proved disastrous, so she put together a new act. She first became famous performing at the Gaiety Theater in Montreal in 1944. Her club acts quickly became the talk of the town as she would be seen taking a bath on stage or doing the reverse strip. One famous gimmick involved having her G-string, which was attached to a fishing rod, fly off into the balcony as the lights dimmed. This gimmick was known as the ""Flying G,"" and other such novelty bits of business became trademarks as well. She eventually conquered Las Vegas, and it was there that she created her ""bubble bath"" bit on stage while being dressed by a maid for the crowd. Her notoriety eventually extended outside the U.S.; she was especially well received in Montreal. While Lili was featured in a couple of mainstream acting roles in movies, including Asfalto rosso (1954) and Il nudo e il morto (1958), she usually played a stripper or appeared as herself. Some short soft-core films which featured her dancing are more interesting today, such as the Irving Klaw film Varietease (1954). Lili's private life was a feast for the tabloids: six marriages, highly publicized brawls, and attempted suicides. She eventually tired of it all and retreated, starting up a Frederick's of Hollywood-like lingerie business. Her last decades were spent in virtual seclusion until her death on January 29, 1999.","June 3, 1918 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA",1918-06-03,"Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","January 29, 1999 in Los Angeles, California, USA  (undisclosed)",1999-01-29,"Los Angeles, California, USA  ",undisclosed,"Joe Zomar  (30 October 1959 - 8 July 1964) (divorced)

nm0820544,Michael St. Gerard,Michael G. Kallassy,,"This moody, baby-faced hunk had the slick, sullen, magnetic good looks and rebel attitude of an Elvis Presley, not to mention a startling resemblance. Sure enough, the timing would prove right for Michael St. Gerard, making a killer impression on teenage girls first on film, then TV -- as greaser types and even Elvis himself -- in the early 90s. Born in New York Mills, New York, he developed an early interest in acting and first found work in Japanese commercials and the off-Broadway stage. He made a strong impression in an otherwise mediocre teen film Una settimana da mito (1987), then really set the wheels in motion with his second film, the John Waters' retro classic Grasso è bello (1988) in which Ricki Lake pines for the St. Gerard amid an American Bandstand type setting circa 1962. The amiable and tuneful satire worked perfectly and St. Gerard managed to stand out among the cult figures who appeared, including Divine, Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry. He got to play Presley twice in films with Il cuore di Dixie (1989) and Great Balls of Fire! - Vampate di fuoco (1989), the latter film a biopic on Jerry Lee Lewis, played all-out by Dennis Quaid. So much attention was placed on St. Gerard's Elvis imitation that the producers of a new TV series looking to recapture Elvis' early years had to look no further. The highly ambitious Elvis (1990) ran for 10 episodes and St. Gerard was magnificent in the role, with Millie Perkins and Billy Green Bush equally terrific as his parents, Gladys and Vernon Presley. The show, however, was canceled despite the critical praise heaped upon it. Michael moved ahead to the popular teen show Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990), playing an acting teacher in it second season, but this time Luke Perry and Jason Priestley grabbed the sexy attention. From there a few insignificant direct-to-video exports materialized, such as Shotgun - Insieme ad ogni costo (1991), I dinamitardi (1992) and Replikator (1994), but his career had simmered. In 1994, St. Gerard had a spiritual awakening after leading a Sunday School class, and, with it, decided to retire and focus his energies on religious instruction. He subsequently became a pastor in the Harlem area of New York City, extending himself and his church in particular to inner-city youths, and spends little time reflecting on his past stardom.","January 22, 1961 in New York Mills, New York, USA",1961-01-22,"New York Mills, New York, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

He started writing and performing in his own short plays in elementary school and developed a strong interest in acting after appearing in a production of ""Othello"". A stint with the Air Force in 1952 during the Korean War temporarily interrupted his professional momentum, but he managed to arrange plays and entertain servicemen during his stay of duty. Upon his discharge, he refocused, auditioned and was accepted into both the Actor's Studio and Herbert Berghof's Institute while modeling, dish washing and working as a sales clerk at Bloomingdale's to make ends meet. At around this time, he changed his stage moniker from the very common name of Raymond Johnson to Ray Saint Jacques (later Raymond St. Jacques) to avoid confusion with other actors. St. Jacques went on to perform for the American Shakespearean Festival, Stratford Connecticut, and, in addition to acting and assistant directing, was relied upon to train other actors in the art of swordplay as he had grown to become an accomplished fencing master. He made his Broadway bow in the 1955 musical ""Seventh Heaven"" and appeared in various on- and off-Broadway productions including ""The Blacks"", ""Night Life"", ""The Cool World"" and ""A Raisin in the Sun"". He also continued to performed in the Bard's plays, including ""Henry V"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Julius Caesar"". He started gracing films in mid-career, making his debut with Black Like Me (1964). His breakthrough role came with the otherwise tepidly-received I commedianti (1967) where he stole the thunder from under husband and wife Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. This led to a series of black-oriented 'stud' roles in Tradimento (1968), Change of Mind (1969), I diamanti sono pericolosi (1972), and notably, Il cocktail del diavolo (1968) (1968) in which he shared some torrid and controversial bed scenes with Barbara McNair that made the ""Sex in the Cinema"" pages of Playboy magazine. He also made history as the first black actor to appear in a regular role on a western series, playing Simon Blake on Gli uomini della prateria (1959). St. Jacques moved briefly into producing and directing with the film Book of Numbers (1973), which relayed the stories of various African-Americans during the late 1800s. A regular in a number of TV series, he failed to make a deep impression in any of them to earn him top-flight stardom, but did distinguish himself in an array of guest star roles, over 300 in his career.

nm0820580,Jasmin St. Claire,Rhea Alexandra DeVlugt,170,"Jasmin St. Claire shot to fame as ""America's Most Controversial Sex Symbol"" after appearing in the top-selling adult films of the late 1990s. She created an outlaw rock star image that at times scandalized the adult industry. Her acerbic humor and willingness to mock her own porn stardom made her one of the highest rated guests on Howard Stern's radio show and related broadcasts for E! Entertainment. St. Claire's first mainstream appearances were in significant comic roles in Communication Breakdown and in National Lampoon Dorm Daze 2. More recently, while studying in Bill O'Leary's Acting Workshop, St. Claire has turned to dramatic roles in thrillers like Angel of Reckoning and the talked about sci-fi drama Trial Run. St. Claire is often cast in ethnically ambiguous roles, or as Italian or Middle Eastern, but she identifies as a Latina due to her mixed Northern European and Brazilian ancestry.St. Claire's background is almost entirely at odds with her early adult-film career. She was born Rhea De Vlugt in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Her father, from Holland, operated a food distribution company. Her mother was a U.S.-educated lawyer, originally from Brazil. St. Claire grew up on Manhattan's Upper west side and attended the Lycee Francais and McBurney School, whose alumni include Henry Winkler and J.D. Salinger. St. Claire graduated from Brooklyn Friends School at age 16, with honors for her work in the pioneering ""Art without Walls"" tutoring program for inner city youth. Upon graduation from Columbia University, St, Claire became a financial consultant at S. G. Warburg (then, a division of Swiss Bank.). But while in a physically abusive relationship with a prominent Manhattan lawyer (whom St. Claire later outed in an interview with Howard Stern), she began a secret life as a topless dancer at Manhattan's infamous KitKat Club, then at Flashdancers.St. Claire entered the adult industry on a dare. Invited on the Jerry Springer Show for a scripted role as antagonistic stripper, St. Claire invented her larger-than-life ""Jasmin St. Claire"" persona. St. Claire's flare for theater and controversy marked her ascent in the adult film world. She polarized the industry by calling porn films ""by and large, disgusting and brainless."" But she quickly dethroned Jenna Jameson as America's top-selling porn star, and became the first Latina to surpass traditional blond porn star archetypes when her films achieved number one sales position in 1998. She was inducted in AVN's ""Hall of Fame"" as one of the greatest porn stars of all time. St. Claire was among the first adult performers to be merchandised as an action figure and to star in an adult comic book series. At the height of her porn stardom, St. Claire was the subject of critical essays by David Foster Wallace and Evan Wright. She also served as inspiration for Chuck Palahniuk's novel Snuff, in which she appears as a character. For all the controversy she engendered, St. Claire only spent three years in the adult business and made just over two dozen films. In 1999, she retired. She never made an adult film again, though compilations of old footage re-released under new titles continued to be sold through the 2000s. St. Claire pushed herself to new extremes by becoming a pro-wrestler. In 1998 the Dudley Boyz invited her to appear in the ECW's Living Dangerously pay-per-view event. St. Claire subsequently trained under Sue Sexton and Mando Guerrero, then worked with wrestling legend Jimmy Lawler in the Memphis Championship and in the XWF and NWA-TNA. St. Claire often played the role of ""manager,"" who would enter the ring and fight alongside wrestlers. In real life, St. Claire created the upstart federation 3PW becoming the first female owner ever to operate and promote a wrestling league, five years before Stephanie McMahon took the reigns of the WWE. St. Claire closed the doors to 3PW in 2005. St. Claire became a heavy-metal journalist and on-air personality with the launch of the Metals Darkside series in 2004, which she also produced. Her interest in heavy metal stretches back to the first Black Sabbath show she attended at Madison Square Garden when she was nine. In 1998 she became the first female to emcee March Metal Meltdown in New Jersey, helping to introduce Sepultura to a North American audience. Through the mid-2000s St. Claire served as a veejay for The Metal Scene TV Show, AOL Noisecreep, Inferno TV and Stay Heavy TV, while writing articles as a contributor to Yahoo News and Guitar Player. She also served as a spokes model for B.C. Rich Guitars, Coffin Case, Krank Amplifiers and licensed her likeness to Guitar Hero for a controller made by Peavey. St. Claire returned to acting 2013 in a series of dramatic roles, portraying an FBI agent in Army of the Damned and hardened street criminal in Grand Auto Theft. Continuing intensive studies under Bill O' Leary, she has recently been cast in significant roles in Celebrapy, Angel of Reckoning and Blue Suede to name a few. She was also in 2 award winning films ""After Adderall"" and "" Trial Run"". Jasmin has recently completed the long form improvisation program at the prestigious Upright Citizens Brigade and is now at the Second City Conservatory in Hollywood. She was a special guest story teller for the Flying Chucks Improv Team at Second City. Jasmin also has her own heavy metal radio show ""Jasmin's Asylum"" on Los Anarchy Radio station on Yo Radio.","October 23, 1970 in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands",1970-10-23,"St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands",,,,,"Petter Bjørn Kristiansen  (21 July 2013 - present)

The next year, David Smallbone was offered a job in America and the whole family packed up to move with him. Unfortunately, the job soon fell through.

nm0820615,Betta St. John,Betty Jean Striegler,161,"Born in Hawthorne, California (Los Angeles area) on November 26, 1929, the former Betty Jean Striegler was part of the Meglin Kiddies troupe as a child and entered pictures in her adolescent years. Betta made her film debut at age 10 with an unbilled role of a little girl who sings Marlene Dietrich's song ""Little Joe"" in the classic western Partita d'azzardo (1939) starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart. She went on to also appear in an Our Gang short and had unbilled orphan roles in both La porta proibita (1943) and Lydia (1941). She was also a one-time model.The musical team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein took sharp notice of this young, attractive singing/dancing teen talent and gave her a small role in Broadway's ""Carousel"" in 1945. Four years later, when they were ready to cast the exotic role of ""Liat"" for their upcoming musical ""South Pacific"" starring Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza, they had to look no further than darkly beautiful Betta St. John. The Broadway show was a blockbuster hit come opening night. While performing in the show's London tour at the Theatre Royale Drury Lane Theatre early in 1952, she met and worked with British opera singer and cast member Peter Grant (he played Lt. Cable). They married on November 27th of that year and remained so until his death in 1992.The musical splash Betta made on Broadway suddenly reopened the door for some decorative film work. She made her adult debut in the second femme lead (behind Deborah Kerr) in La sposa sognata (1953). In this she plays Tarji, a princess, who is courted by bachelor tycoon Cary Grant. This led to other ""B""-level co-star/featured parts in a number of exotic eastern and western adventures throughout the 1950's including Miriam in the biblical epic La tunica (1953); Lady Iolanthe opposite Ricardo Montalban in La fortezza dei tiranni (1954); Princess Johanna in Il principe studente (1954); outlaw Billy the Kid's (played by Scott Brady) love interest in La legge contro Billy Kid (1954); a British belle in the mystery drama Alias John Preston (1955) which had a small featured role for husband Peter Grant; an alternative to ""Jane"" in Tarzan e il safari perduto (1957) starring Gordon Scott; and a Canadian islander (she is top-billed) in the British-made Alta marea a mezzogiorno (1957).After numerous guest appearances on TV here and in England, Betta co-starred with Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee in the British-made horror [linktt0051542] and Lee again in the horror La città dei morti (1960), and made one more movie excursion into the jungle with Gordon Scott's Tarzan in Tarzan il magnifico (1960) before abandoning the limelight altogether.","November 26, 1929 in Hawthorne, California, USA",1929-11-26,"Hawthorne, California, USA",,,,,Peter Grant  (27 November 1952 - 1992) (his death) (3 children),1,0,1,3

He grew in popularity with such theater hits as ""Janie"" (1942) and ""The Late George Apley"" (1946) and ""Two Blind Mice"" (1949). He took his patented gruffness and moved into films with the ""B"" movie Fiori nel fango (1949) and continued in the same no-nonsense vein as various business tycoons or high-ranking military brass. Standout roles in his over 30 pictures include Nata ieri (1950) and Uno, due, tre! (1961).

A story of hers was adapted into another talkie classic, A che prezzo Hollywood? (1932), the precursor of the 1937's È nata una stella (1937) and its two remakes.Earl Rogers, a lawyer whose reputation for winning acquittals in seemingly hopeless cases was so great that another legend of the bar, Clarence Darrow, used his services in a jury tampering case, was a friend of newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst. As a nineteen-year-old, the teen-aged Adela became a reporter for ""San Francisco Examiner"", Hearst's self-heralded ""Monarch of the Dailies"". As a cub reporter working her way up the ranks, she covered everything from crime and sports to politics and high society.She quit the newspaper racket in the early part of The Roaring Twenties to became a freelance writer.

Beginning in 1926, Stabile worked for a decade as a sideman with the orchestras of George Olsen and Ben Bernie, before forming his own dance band in New York, in April 1936. Introduced by his own composition, ""Blue Nocturne"", Stabile enjoyed a lengthy engagement at the Lincoln Hotel in New York, before going on an extended tour of ballrooms and hotels across the United States. At this time, he featured a predominant reed sextet and several good musicians, including composer/arranger Chauncey Gray, as well as vocalists Paula Kelly and Gracie Barrie. The latter wound up to become Mrs. Stabile and fronted the orchestra, when her husband was called up for military service in the Coast Guard in 1942.After World War II, Stabile based himself on the West Coast and led his band for eight years at Ciro's Le Disc in West Hollywood. He also worked for nine years as arranger and musical director on The Colgate Comedy Hour (1950), featuring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, occasionally appearing in the duo's films at Paramount. Stabile remained active as a bandleader well into the 1970's, with engagements in Las Vegas, at the Cocoanut Grove and (leading the orchestra-in-residence) at the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans. In addition to his theme song, Stabile composed several other popular tunes, such as ""Cloudburst"", ""Raindrops on the River"" and ""That's How I Need You"". During it's heyday, his band had lucrative recording contracts with Decca, Bluebird, Victor and Vocalion. At one time, Dick Stabile was also featured in ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" for his ability to blow the highest note possible on the saxophone.","May 29, 1909 in Newark, New Jersey, USA",1909-05-29,"Newark, New Jersey, USA","September 25, 1980 in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA  (undisclosed)",1980-09-25,"New Orleans, Louisiana, USA  ",undisclosed,Shirley Harp  (18 August 1963 - ?),1,0,0,0

Mr. Stachura is married to actress and writer Shari Shattuck and has two daughters Creason Carbo and Calee Maudin. A native of Los Angeles, Mr. Stachura had already appeared in several stage plays, and made his debuts on film and television by the age of fifteen.

nm0821041,Robert Stack,Robert Langford Modini Stack,183,"""Straight Shooting"" - whether skeet shooting, or portraying Eliot Ness, Robert Stack always tells it like it is, and shoots straight. Robert was the second child of Elizabeth Modini Wood (who named him Charles after his grandfather) and James Langford Stack (who changed his name to Robert, after no one in particular). Even though Robert was born in Los Angeles, since his parents divorced when he was one-year-old, and his mother took him to Europe when he was three, he could not speak English until he was six; (his older brother James Langford Jr., stayed in the United States with their father). Robert spoke fluent Italian and French, but had to learn English when they returned to Los Angeles. His mother and father remarried in 1928. Robert took drama courses at USC. He was not interested in team sports, so he took up skeet shooting. In 1935, he came in second in the National Skeet Shooting Championship (held in Cleveland) and, in 1936, his 5-man team broke the standing record at the National Skeet Championships (held in St. Louis).Robert arrived at Universal City Studios in 1939, when the movie studio (once riding high on the successes of movies like Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931)) was in financial trouble, and looking for a superstar. That superstar was Deanna Durbin (acquired from MGM), and Robert made his screen debut as her lover in Il primo bacio (1939). At first, Robert did not want to listen to the makeup man who had told him, ""no blond has ever made it as a leading man"", and insisted on dyeing his hair black and uncurling it. That makeup man was genius and Oscar winner, Jack P. Pierce (who had done all the monsters for Universal), and Robert became a matinee idol, overnight. After two more movies, Robert was teamed with Deanna again, in Una ragazza per bene (1941). Robert was now a bona-fide star, but Universal was still only paying him $150 a week. For the next 10 years, Robert did Westerns, war movies and romantic comedies.Robert has particularly fond memories for L'amante del torero (1951), a movie produced by his friend, John Wayne, which meant 12 weeks filming in sunny Mexico. The movie had a great script; unfortunately, two bullfighters were gored while filming. There were several weeks of delays, they could not get a crew or a sound stage, until they realized that, in Mexico, it is necessary to bribe the local union; some money was passed and filming started, immediately. There were wild times, and lots of tequila. Robert became a local legend; when some Mexicans asked him what he did in the War, Robert said: ""I taught machine gun"". The rumor spread: ""Roberto teaches chingas!"" (that's Spanish for ""hookers""). In 1952, Robert made movie history (much like Al Jolson had done in 1927, being in the first ""talkie"") - he starred in Bwana Devil (1952), the first 3-D movie. This gave startling effects to the story, which was based on real-life lion attacks in Africa.Robert attended the premiere, and recalled people's reactions to the 3-D lion scenes: ""People in the audience jumped out of their seats, some even fainted."" The movie broke box office records, and immediately started the demand to film more movies in 3-D (such as La maschera di cera (1953)). Around 1955, Robert (Hollywood's most eligible bachelor) was introduced to Rosemarie Bowe, by mutual agent Bill Shiffrin. Rosemarie had been under contract to MGM and Columbia, making such movies as La ninfa degli antipodi (1952) and Il pescatore di Haiti (1954). Robert and Rosemarie got married around 1957, and had two wonderful kids: Elizabeth Stack and Charles Stack. The perennial bachelor found out he liked being married and being a father. Robert's onscreen fame had grown and, for Come le foglie al vento (1956), he received an Academy Award nomination. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with 20th-Century Fox, which had Robert under contract, and had lent him to Universal for this picture.Robert talks of a few run-ins with a mystery woman he calls ""Deirdre"", which cost him his next plum movie role. Although he gives her this pseudonym, he drops over a half dozen bits of information about her... she was from the South, under contract to MGM, married a young actor, had an interest in bullfighters, and (refusing to work with Robert Stack) starred with Tyrone Power and Errol Flynn in a movie about a post-World War I ""lost generation""; (which could be Il sole sorgerà ancora (1957), and the mystery woman could be Ava Gardner). His contract with Fox came to an end. And so, Robert made the transition to the new medium that was sweeping the country: television. He delivered breakout performances in his signature role as T-man (Treasury agent) Eliot Ness on the wildly popular television series, Gli intoccabili (1959) which, after the pilot, ran for four seasons (118 episodes). And there was also the television movie, FBI contro Al Capone (1959).There were some funny behind-the-scenes anecdotes, such as this one: there is no scene which stood out more as the most potentially evil, and risky in terms of audience acceptance, as the ""bacio di morte"" (kiss of death), the Sicilian gesture when the Capo (Neville Brand) kissed a Mafia soldier (Frank DeKova) to send him out as an executioner. These two macho actors were nervous enough about this scene (two guys had never kissed on television before), but then some crewman decided to be a prankster and told each star, in private, just before filming, ""look out -- your co-star likes kissing guys"" (a complete deception, of course). There were some sad anecdotes: Joseph Wiseman was a fine actor, but trained to work on the New York stage with props; he was not accustomed to real Hollywood sets. In a 1960 episode of ""The Untouchables"", he was supposed to take an axe and smash up a brewery. He hit a real pipe, the axe ricocheted off the metal, and cut through his Achilles tendon.""I never felt so sorry for anyone in my life"", Robert commented. They wrote a role for Joseph as a crippled, renegade chemist a few weeks later in ""The Antidote"" which Robert noted ""was one of our half-dozen top shows"". Robert went on to do television series, such as Reporter alla ribalta (1968) alternating lead with Gene Barry and Anthony Franciosa then later Squadra Speciale Most Wanted (1976), and he pleasantly surprised everyone with his flair for comedies in movies like 1941 - Allarme a Hollywood (1979) and L'aereo più pazzo del mondo (1980). Robert was the host of Unsolved Mysteries (1987) and did more zany humor in Due palle in buca (1988), Beavis & Butt-head alla conquista dell'America (1996) and Baseketball (1998). He also provided the voice of the character Ultra Magnus in The Transformers: The Movie (1986). He even portrayed the no-nonsense G-man, again, in The Return of Eliot Ness (1991).

nm0821043,Rosemarie Stack,Rose Marie Bowe,165,"Rosemarie Bowe frequently turned heads with her flashing turquoise eyes, sultry mane of black hair and sparkling personality. Effortlessly diverting attention from the scenic location spots of her mid-'50s film adventures and dramas, her stroll before the cameras was short--it was over within a few years.The Montana-born beauty was the daughter of a building contractor, Dennis Bowe, and his wife Ruby. She and her siblings (Clara and Sydney) were raised in Tacoma, Washington, where Rosemarie first developed an interest in the arts. Dancing and appearing in operetta-styled musicals at her high school in Tacoma, she graduated and attended Tacoma Community College for one semester before being drawn to modeling. Finding work as a photographer's model and fashion cover girl in the Seattle area, she was the winner of pageant titles, including ""Miss Tacoma"", and was an official entrant in the ""Miss Washington"" contest. Eventually she relocated to Los Angeles, where she ultimately made the cover of Life magazine, among others.Rosemarie broke into films in the early 1950s, primarily as an extra (model, swimmer) in MGM musicals. Within a few years she had moved into TV episodic work and earned a co-starring role in the voodoo adventure Il pescatore di Haiti (1954) which was written and directed by Abner Biberman under the pseudonym Joel Judge (he also had a supporting role as her father). The film, starring Shirley Temple's ex, John Agar, was obvious hokum but did take the time to emphasize its lovely newcomer. Rosemarie was quite stunning as a jungle captive and signed on to play a few other decorative, damsel-in-distress roles.Nothing-special movies more or less came and went but did little to test her dramatic mettle; they were, however, providing the requisite building ground for her to move up the Hollywood ranks. Le avventure di Hajji Babà (1954) had Rosemarie playing a slave girl in support of dashing young commoner John Derek and spirited princess Elaine Stewart. In the noirish The Big Bluff (1955), Rosemarie provided a harder edge as a married nightclub singer dallying on the side with lothario John Bromfield who, in turn, is making a play for the affections of wealthy but terminally ill widow Martha Vickers. Il treno del ritorno (1955) focused more on star Dana Wynter, a scene-stealing Marjorie Rambeau and its Southern-bred racism theme than on Rosemarie's secondary role. Her last leading film assignment was in the preachy western The Peacemaker (1956) as a benevolent lady who tries to help gunfighter-turned-minister James Mitchell (who was then better known for his dancing skills in musicals) tame a corrupt town.Rosemarie ended her career after marrying Robert Stack, 13 years her senior, on January 23, 1956. The couple eventually became the parents of a daughter (Elizabeth) and son (Charles). Sharing a love with her husband for the outdoors, especially sailing and horseback riding, Rosemarie enjoyed life as a Hollywood celebrity and socialite and expressed no regrets in ending her career. In October of 1969 she survived a serious automobile accident in Sacramento that killed her husband's cousin and left her with injuries requiring plastic surgery. Occasionally she came out of her self-imposed retirement to appear on TV, usually in vehicles starring her husband, such as the mini-movie Murder on Flight 502 (1975). Robert Stack died in 2003 after 47 years of marriage.","September 17, 1932 in Butte, Montana, USA",1932-09-17,"Butte, Montana, USA","January 20, 2019 in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico  (undisclosed)",2019-01-20,"Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico  ",undisclosed,Robert Stack  (23 January 1956 - 14 May 2003) (his death) (2 children),1,0,1,2

As a teen, Stacy first aspired to play professional football but settled on a career in the movies after a friend coaxed him into taking some acting classes.Adopting the screen name James Stacy after his cousin Stacy and one of his movie idols, James Dean, he made his film debut in an uncredited role as a reporter in Sayonara (1957), starring Marlon Brando. Garnering little work or recognition in film, he turned to TV. Although he made notable appearances on The Donna Reed Show (1958) and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952), it wasn't until 1968 that he gained his first big break, playing a young gunfighter on the TV series, Lancer (1968).Although the show was canceled in 1970, Stacy continued to land smaller roles on TV. In 1973, he lost his left arm and left leg in a serious motorcycle accident that claimed the life of his girlfriend. The resultant medical bills wiped out his savings, but his ex-wives and his Hollywood friends rallied round and threw a benefit for him. Two years later, he made his professional comeback as a newspaper editor in the Western film, I giustizieri del West (1975), in a role created expressly for him by the film's director, Kirk Douglas. Stacy was nominated twice for an Emmy: for Just a Little Inconvenience (1977) in 1977 and New York New York (1981) in 1986. He retired in 1991.Stacy's personal life was turbulent.

nm0821108,O.B. Stade,Otto Max Bernhard Stade,,"Glendora, California resident and renown scholar, Odo B. Stade's life included a career as Navy lieutenant, charge d'affaires in Mexico, author, poet, actor, stunt pilot, manager and owner of the Hollywood Bookstore, teacher and world traveler. His challenging and rewarding life brought him in contact with many parts of the world, many professions and people from all walks of life.Born July 2, 1892, in Saint Louis, Alsace (France), he was the first of eight children of one of the oldest family clans (Stade ab Palffy) in Hungary. As a child Odo spent six months in Strassburg, and the other six months in the family country place at Trentschen Teplitz, Hungary. There was a great estate in Hungary; a hunting lodge in the Tartara Mountains (The Russians took it after WW II) There was a tremendous stand of virgin forest. The place in Budapest was 600 years old, and the family had a little palace in Vienna. Odo was given instruction by a tutor who remained with him until he was ready to go to the University where he majored in philology.Odo graduated ""cum laude"" when only fifteen and was able to join the Naval Academy in 1907 at Pola. During these years and the subsequent years as Naval lieutenant, he saw much of the world, including North and South America.Following his uncle's wish, he resigned from the Navy in 1912 and joined the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office. At the end of November 1912, Odo received orders to leave for Mexico as charge d'affaires. The Austrian Minister had been absent from Mexico City since early in 1910 and Odo had the ungrateful task of creating order out of chaos, a condition aggravated by the revolution in that unhappy country.Having seen the peon system in Hungary, he believed it was even worse in Mexico. Sympathizing with the commoner, Odo was against Huerta, the new dictator, so he joined the opposition, Francisco (Pancho) Villa, the underdog. Now employed by the international cartel, French-owned International Company of Mines and Exploration, Odo entered into an agreement with Villa: if Villa permitted his gold shipments to leave the troubled country, Odo would represent Villa in securing munitions and supplies for the rebel forces.As Villa's purchasing agent charged with developing an air force, his job sent him back and forth across the border to purchase guns, ammunition, and all the material essentials for Villa's soldiers, horses, and vehicles. Odo managed to ship $14 million in gold bullion from the country before he had to leave Mexico. During this time he met most of the leaders and generals, among them Carranza, Felipe Angeles, Governor Jesus Maria Maytorena, &c. and made numerous trips to Washington to consult with Ambassador Dumba. President Wilson personally consulted with Odo during some of these trips to learn about the progress of Villa.Odo was wounded twice, and once had his knee shot to pieces. Before the revolution was over, he left Mexico, suffering from typhoid malaria and in a desperate physical condition. Illness and wounds forced Odo to go to California in order to regain his health. It was during this last escape to California that Odo brought with him many of Villa's personal effects, including a pair of boots, saddle, rifle, and Colt revolver, which he gave to young Michael Rubel in the 1960s.Upon arriving in California, Odo called on Mr. Adam Clark Vroman, famous photographer and prominent bookseller of Pasadena, California. Mr. Vroman offered to employ him as a clerk in his store. Odo accepted the kind offer and remained with Mr. Vroman for some six months, when he was forced to quit his job by his lingering illness.His doctor recommended living in the wild, so in May of 1916 Odo hiked to Tahoe and on to the High Sierras where he lived off the land for six months. He had weighed only 108 pounds when he left for the mountains, and when he came back, he weighed 174. During this phase he helped establish the altitudes of many of the Sierra peaks.Hollywood Book Store, opposite Hollywood HotelUpon his return from the Sierras Odo accepted, encouraged by Mr. Vroman, the managership of the Hollywood Bookstore, then owned by Mr. Frederick G. Leonard. At that time, Hollywood was still a small town and the motion picture industry in its infancy. The social life centered around the Hollywood Hotel and the cultural life around the bookstore and small library across the street. Odo was the first to write book reviews for the recently founded ""Holly Leaves,"" a magazine printing motion picture news, social news and the life of the community as a whole.1915 was also the year Odo first visited Glendora, which was ""back country."" Michigan Avenue (now Glendora Ave.) was the only oiled street in town. At this time Odo visited the ranger station. Head ranger Sloan was planting trees at the time, and Odo planted a pine near the station. The ranger station still stands as a residence and the Torrey Pine Odo planted was, in 1957, recognized as the second largest Torrey Pine in California.By 1919 the motion picture industry was coming into its own. European talent, displaced by the war and its aftermath, saw Hollywood as a Mecca and writers, actors, and directors came in ever increasing numbers, all of them discovering the Hollywood Bookstore sooner or later, and Odo, the bookseller and linguist came into his own. He also had bit acting parts in numerous silent films, including ""Blind Husband,"" ""Miracle Man,"" ""World and Its Woman,"" and ""The Right to Happiness."" With training from aerial pioneer Dick Grece, Odo also became a movie stunt pilot and wing walker, defying death as he flew in W.W. I aerial combat scenes for these movies and propaganda films.By 1920 French, German, Italian and Spanish books had to be added to the stock of books and it presently became necessary to move the store to larger quarters. At the sale time, Mr. Leonard purchased the Loftus Art Shop and combined it with the bookstore. Both stores grew rapidly with booming Hollywood. Greater and greater demands were made upon Odo and his staff and frequently Odo was approached by the diverse studios to assist in research. His establishment soon became known as one of the leading bookstores of the Pacific Coast, and Odo Stade the resident expert. He encouraged competition, helped Unity Peque and Jake Zeitlin to start stored of their own by giving them stock and time. He did in Hollywood what Mr. Vroman had done in Pasadena.In 1923, Odo, hitherto a confirmed bachelor, met Maria Engel, who had come that year as assistant to Howard Greer, the designer, under contract to Famous Players-La ski Studios. It was love at first sight. The same studio gave Odo the commission in 1924 to obtain research in Hollywood and its Long Island Studios. This trip took Odo through most of the European countries and confirmed him in his opinion that his life was to be in the United States henceforth, especially since his uncle strenuously objected to his marrying a commoner. This break was never healed, Odo was cut off from his family and gladly returned to Hollywood in October 1924. A few days after his return, he married Maria Engel, who left her lucrative position with the studio to assist him by taking charge of the Hollywood Art Shop, where she achieved in a short while the same success as he had done with the bookstore.In March 1925, Frederick G. Leonard sold his interests in both stores to Maria and Odo Stade and Robert and Emma Holmes; the latter the two silent partners. That year the store had to be enlarged once more and presently a rare book section was added. By this time, the Hollywood Bookstore had become known from coast to coast. Those were busy years for Maria and Odo; the sales in both departments reached the half million mark by 1928. When in 1930 the Booksellers' Convention was held in Los Angeles, Odo was chosen Bookseller of the Pacific Coast.The stock market debacle of 1929 was a serious set-back, but by cutting corners and careful management Odo and Maria weathered the storm. However the hoped for recovery did not come and in 1932, when economical conditions were going from bad to worse, Emma Holmes, the silent partner and majority stockholder, forced the Stades to sell their interests to her at a considerable sacrifice to them. With Odo out of the store, the Hollywood Bookstore did not outlast the change very long.After a long rest at the Loomis Ranch, the Stades took up residence in Topanga, where Odo began writing again, encouraged by early successes in 1919, at which time he had sold numerous short stories and epigrams to H.L. Mencken, then editor of ""Smart Set Magazine."" During the next ten years Odo wrote numerous short stories, novelettes, two novels and, in collaboration with Edgecumb Pinchon, the biography ""Viva Villa,"" which was sold to the MGM Studios, and as a motion picture achieved a considerable success, being nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards in 1935, and earning $17 million for MGM by the late 1950s.In 1942 Odo answered President Roosevelt's appeal for all able bodied men to do their share in the war. He applied to the U.S. Navy, but was rejected on account of the wounds sustained with Pancho Villa. Odo next applied to the U.S. Forest Service, and in 1943 was given the position of District Dispatcher, Mt. Baldy District, Angeles National Forest. He resigned from the Forest Service in 1958 after fifteen years of dedicated service. During these years he was involved with several youth groups helping to ""train youth to live."" In 1963 he was elected ""Outstanding Educator"" by the students of Brown's Military Academy where he taught modern languages.Mr. Stade was honored by the citizens of Glendora who voted him Citizen of the Year in 1956 for his outstanding contributions to all the people of the San Gabriel Valley area. He and his wife Maria also served throughout the 1950s and -60s on various committees and the San Gabriel Valley Symphony Association.In the 1960s and 70s Odo served on the Board of Trustees of the Francis Bacon Library and Foundation. Fluent in many languages with a broad knowledge on history and literature, he translated many literary works and won a reputation as outstanding scholar.Odo B. Stade lived a life of dedicated service, committed to helping others, especially young people. Chris and Michael Rubel, and later Scott and Clarke Rubel, are four youths who benefitted from Odo's friendship and generosity of spirit. In fact as a child Michael didn't appreciate school much and often wanted to skip it. Of course his mother would not approve of his playing hookey. If, however, Michael said he wanted to spend the day with Odo rather than go to school, his mother said, ""Well you'll probably learn more from him than you will in school, so go ahead."" Odo and Maria hosted Scott and Clarke at their home nearly every day during much of the 1960s, reading or discussing books and philosophy and teaching them all their young brains could absorb (when they really went over for the cookies). Odo taught Scott, as a teenager, the tricks of fast-draw with a six-shooter in the big back yard of Leadora Avenue.Odo's mother was Hungarian. The family name was Szechenye. His father was Norwegian, Flemish and French, and his name was De Stade. He was a surgeon, and worked on the development and perfection of twilight sleep. Odo's mother thus married a commoner...a surgeon, and the family cut her off.When the first son (Odo) was born, the uncle brought the family together, and Odo was designated to take on the name of Palffy when he became off age. This is why he spent six months in Hungary each year, learning the ancestral traditions and the family ways.The De Stade family was musical. One sister played the viola. Odo's mother played the piano beautifully and sang. Odo played the violin, and played in symphony concerts before he was sixteen.Odo wanted to become a doctor, but his father objected. At the age of 14, Odo recalls that he assisted his father in an emergency operation, after being awakened in the night. During the last ten years of his life, Odo's father was the court surgeon. He died at the age of 58 on a visit to his sister's home in Brazil.One evening early in 1924, Maria went to the Hollywood Bookstore. As she reached the door, the proprietor was locking it up. However, to be accommodating, he went back in to get the book she wanted. She ordered some German books also. Odo went off to the mountains and three weeks later had the books delivered with a note, asking if he might call.After their marriage, Maria continued with her career in the design. Her knowledge of clothes, millinery and design have remained a primary interest, and she has reached a highly deserved pinnacle teaching and creating in adult education classes in Glendora where she lived through the 1980s.When she and Odo were first married, his uncle wanted him to return to Hungary, but Maria felt within herself that she would never be accepted by the royal family or the peasants.Maria spent the 80s holding discussion and reading groups in her home, with a focus on the spiritual world and the world's religions, diverging into aspects of living with ghosts and her own belief in astral projection. She was an enthusiast of the writings of Max Freedom Long, and gave Scott Rubel her first edition set based on the ""Secret Science Behind Miracles,"" a fascinating document of the last years of the Kahunas on the Hawaiian Islands, including the inner workings of their magic and religion. This and many other literary gifts from Maria encouraged Scott's interest in books and greatly expanded his collection of first editions at the time.The rest of Odo's collection of first editions was a donation to the library at Azusa Pacific, and the collection is still known today as the Odo B. Stade collection.","July 2, 1892 in Krautheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany",1892-07-02,"Krautheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany","March 5, 1976 in San Bernardino, California, USA",1976-03-05,"San Bernardino, California, USA",,,0,0,0,0

Part of the presentation involved a pre-teen Hildegarde, appearing fully nude, with a python draped around her shoulders. Though she did not draw upon this particular anecdote, her experience with her uncle greatly influenced her script for Narcotic (1933). She married Dwain Esper in 1920, who would later become a notorious exploitation film producer. When Dwain assumed ownership of a small studio facility in Los Angeles, California in 1930, they began producing films from scripts which she wrote. The couple cranked out several low-budget pictures. Some of them, such as Maniac (1934) and Marihuana (1936), remain so bizarre and prurient that it is hard to imagine a husband and wife with two children producing them. In addition to making films for the exploitation market, Hildegarde and Dwain imported and reissued older films, such as Tod Browning's cult-classic Freaks (1932) and the Danish film Man's Way with Women. Hildegarde usually managed relations with state censorship boards when their films came under criticism from the local morality squad, something she undoubtedly regarded as a necessary irritation.

Living in Los Angeles, her prodigious talent was obvious and she soon joined a baby orchestra in Los Angeles and, within a few years, became a Junior Symphony performer at age six. She also made her unbilled specialty debut on film as a child violinist in Il valzer dell'imperatore (1948), starring Bing Crosby and Joan Fontaine.Her father's business had the family traveling throughout Europe growing up but she later relocated to California and briefly enrolled at Chapman College in the Los Angeles area. Becoming a stunning, statuesque beauty, she re-directed herself back to a career in show business, singing backup on records for Sam Phillips and working as a secretary to make ends meet while appearing in local L.A. stage productions.In 1958, she was approached by a photographer and eventually posed for Playboy magazine, becoming November's centerfold. The attention warranted her an MGM contract and cheesecake bit parts came her way with such movies as Colpo grosso (1960) and Colazione da Tiffany (1961). She appeared front-and-center à la Raquel Welch as a scantily-clad prehistoric turn-on in Valley of the Dragons (1961), but nothing much came of it.Following her perky love interests in the mediocre western Pistole roventi (1966), starring Audie Murphy, and 7 giorni di fifa (1966), a Don Knotts comedy film, and guest appearances on such TV shows as ""Rango,"" ""Pistols and Petticoats, ""Mission: Impossible,"" ""Ironside"" and ""Adam-12,"" Joan's career went on hiatus after a horse-riding accident.Briefly married to Chuck Staley, her second husband is former Universal exec Dale Sheets.

nm0822034,Lionel Stander,Lionel Jay Stander,183,"Lionel Stander, the movie character actor with the great gravelly voice, was born on January 11th, 1908 in The Bronx borough of New York City. Stander's acting career was derailed when he was blacklisted during the 1950s after being exposed as a Communist Party member during the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings. In his own HUAC testimony in May 1953, Stander denounced HUAC's use of informers, particularly those with mental problems.Stander specialized in playing lovable hoodlums and henchmen and assorted acerbic, hard-boiled types. His physique was burly and brutish, and his head featured a square-jaw beneath a coarse-featured pan that was lightened by his charm. But it was his gruff, foghorn voice that made his fortune.Stander attended the University of North Carolina, but after making his stage debut at the age of 19, he decided to give up college for acting. Along with a successful stage career, his unusual voice made him ideal for radio. His movie screen debut was in the comedy short Salt Water Daffy (1933) with Jack Haley and Shemp Howard. He went on to star in a number of two-reel comedy shorts produced at Vitaphone's Brooklyn studio before moving to Hollywood in 1935, where he appeared as a character actor in many A-list features such as Nulla sul serio (1937).John Howard Lawson, the screenwriter who was one of the Hollywood Ten and who served as the Communist Party's cultural commissar in Hollywood, held up Stander as the model of a committed communist actor who enhanced the class struggle through his performances. In the movie No Time to Marry (1938), which had been written by Party member Paul Jarrico, Stander had whistled a few bars of the ""Internationale"" while waiting for an elevator.Stander thought that the scene would be cut from the movie, but it remained in the picture because ""they were so apolitical in Hollywood at the time that nobody recognized the tune"".Stander had a long history of supporting left-wing causes. He was an active member of the Popular Front from 1936-39, a broad grouping of left-wing organizations dedicated to fighting reactionaries at home and fascism abroad. Stander wrote of the time, ""We fought on every front because we realized that the forces of reaction and Faciscm fight democracy on every front. We, too, have been forced, therefore, to organize in order to combat them on every front: politically through such organizations as the Motion Picture Democratic Committee; economically through our guilds and unions; socially, and culturally through such organizations as the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.""The Front disintegrated when the U.S.S.R. signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, which engendered World War II by giving the Nazis the get-go to invade Poland (with the Soviet Union invading from the East). The Communist Party-USA dropped out of the Front and from anti-Nazi activities, and during the early days of the War, before Germany invaded the U.S.S.R. in June 1941, it tried to hamper US support for the UK under the aegis of supporting ""peace,"" including calling strikes in defense plants. Many communists, such as Elia Kazan, dropped out of the Party after this development, but many others stayed. These were the Stalinists that the American non-communist left grew to despise, and eventually joined with the right to destroy, though much of their antipathy after 1947-48 was generated by a desire to save themselves from the tightening noose of reaction.Melvyn Douglas, a prominent liberal whose wife Helen Gahagan Douglas would later be a U.S. Representative from California (and would lose her bid for the Senate to a young Congressman named Richard Nixon, who red-baited her as ""The Pink Lady""), had resisted Stander's attempts to recruit him to the Party. ""One night, Lionel Stander kept me up until dawn trying to sell me the Russian brand of Marxism and to recruit me for the Communist Party. I resisted. I had always been condemnatory of totalitarianism and I made continual, critical references to the U.S.S.R. in my speeches. Members of the Anti-Nazi League would urge me to delete these references and several conflicts ensued.""Douglas, his wife, and other liberals were not adverse to cooperating with Party members and fellow travelers under the aegis of the MPDC, working to oppose fascism and organize relief for the Spanish Republic. They believed that they could minimize Communist Party influence, and were heartened by the fact that the Communists had joined the liberal, patriotic, anti-fascist bandwagon. Their tolerance of Communists lasted until the Soviet-Nazi Pact of August 1939. That, and the invasion of Poland by the Nazis and the USSR shattered the Popular Front.Stander had been subpoenaed by the very first House Un-American Activities Committee inquisition in Hollywood, in 1940, when it was headed by Texas Congressman Martin Dies. The Dies Committee had succeeded in abolishing the Federal Theatre Project of the Works Progress Administration as a left-wing menace in 1939 (the FTP had put on a revival of Lawson's play about the exploitation of miners, ""Prcessional,"" that year in New York). The attack on the FTP had been opposed by many liberals in Hollywood. Stung by the criticisms of Hollywood, the Dies Committee decided to turn its attention on Hollywood itself.Sending investigators to Hollywood, Dies' HUAC compiled a long-list of subversives, including Melvyn Douglas. John L. Leech, a police agent who had infiltrated the Communist Party before being expelled in 1937, presented a list of real and suspected communists to a Los Angeles County grand jury, which also subpoenaed Stander. The testimony was leaked, and the newspapers reported that Stander, along with such prominent Hollywood liberals as James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, Frederic March and Francot Tone, had been identified as communists.Committee chairman Dies offered all of the people named as communists the opportunity to clear themselves if they would cooperate with him in executive session. Only one of the named people did not appear, and Stander was the only one to appear who was not cleared. Subsequently, he was fired by his studio, Republic Pictures.Stander was then subpoenaed to testify before the California Assembly's Committee on Un-American Activities, along with John Howard Lawson, the union leader John Sorrell and others. During the strike led by Sorrell's militant Conference of Student Unions against the studios in 1945, Stander was the head of a group of progressives in the Screen Actors Guild who supported the CSU and lobbied the guild to honor its picket lines. They were outvoted by the more conservative faction headed by Robert Montgomery, George Murphy and Ronald Reagan. The SAG membership voted 3,029 to 88 to cross the CSU picket-line.Stander continued to work after being fired by Republic. He appeared in Anche i boia muoiono (1943), a film about the Nazi Reinhard Heydrich, who was assassinated by anti-fascists. After the bitter CSU strike, which was smeared as being communist-inspired by the studios, HUAC once again turned its gaze towards Hollywood, starting two cycles of inquisitions in 1947 and 1951. The screenwriter Martin Berkeley, who set a record by naming 155 names before the the second round of Committee hearings, testified that Stander had introduced him to the militant labor union leader Harry Bridges, long suspected of being a communist, whom Stander called ""comrade"".After being blacklisted, Stander worked as a broker on Wall Street and appeared on the stage as a journeyman actor. He returned to the movies in Tony Richardson's Il caro estinto (1965), and he began his career anew as a character actor, appearing in many films, including Roman Polanski's Cul de sac (1966) and Martin Scorsese's New York, New York (1977). Other movies he appeared in included Spogliarello per una vedova (1966), L'uccello tutto nero (1975), Cassandra Crossing (1976), 1941 - Allarme a Hollywood (1979), Cookie (1989) and The Last Good Time (1994), his final theatrical film.Stander is best remembered for playing Max on TV's Cuore e batticuore (1979) (1979-84) with Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers, a role he reprised in a series of ""Hart to Hart"" TV movies. Stander also appeared on Wagner's earlier TV series Operazione ladro (1968) and on the HBO series Dream On (1990).Lionel Stander died of lung cancer on November 30, 1994 in Los Angeles, California.

nm0822062,John Standing,John Ronald Leon,,"Sir John Standing is one of England's most respected stage, film and television actors. From a distinguished acting dynasty which includes his great-grandfather Herbert Standing (1846-1923), grandfather Sir Guy Standing (1873-1937) and mother, the actress Kay Hammond, John Robert Leon Standing, born in London on August, 16, 1934, succeeded his father Sir Ronald Leon, as the 4th baronet in 1964.A one-time art student and avid painter, Sir John attended both Millfield Preparatory School and Eton College and made his debut on stage in minor roles in the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company's production of ""Titus Andronicus."" In London from 1959, he worked productively on the London stage (Bristol Old Vic, Chicester, Haymarket, Royal Court) for two decades with a resume that included ""The Darling Buds,"" ""The Irregular Verb to Love,"" ""See How They Run,"" ""The Clandestine Marriage,"" ""The Cherry Orchard,"" ""The Fighting Cock,"" The Beaux' Stratgem,"" ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" (as Algernon), ""Ring Around the Moon,"" ""The Alchemist,"" ""Arms and the Man, ""A Sense of Detachment"" by John Osborne, ""Saint Joan,"" ""Dead-Eyed Dicks,"" ""Plunder,"" ""The Philanderer"" and, most notably, as Elyot Chase in Noël Coward's ""Private Lives,"" co-starring Maggie Smith and directed by John Gielgud, which was taken to Broadway in 1975.Lesser known for his work on the big screen, a few BBC-TV guest parts came to Sir John's way before he entered films in 1962 with featured roles in the light comedy Due mariti per volta (1962) and romantic drama The Wild and the Willing (1962). Standing followed these with performances in such films as Qualcuno da odiare (1965), La bambola di cera (1966), Cammina, non correre (1966), A Touch of Love (1969), All the Right Noises (1970), X Y e Zi (1972), Le femmine sono nate per fare l'amore (1972), La notte dell'aquila (1976), Il testamento (1978), L'oca selvaggia colpisce ancora (1980), The Elephant Man (1980), Privates on Parade (1983), Misteriose forme di vita (1987), Charlot - Chaplin (1992), La signora Dalloway (1997), and a starring role as a businessman who opens a brothel with his playboy son after the death of his wife in the dramedy Otto donne e 1/2 (1999).Sir John had more prestigious work come to him on TV. He lightened up at times as he died as a aristocratic politician who falls for a working class model in the British comedy series Una modella per l'onorevole (1980) and a spy partnered with Tom Conti in Old Boy Network (1992), but found more rewarding work in the classic mini-series The First Churchills (1969), La talpa (1979), I mulini a vento degli dei (1988), The Choir (1995), Club V.R. (1996) and Drovers' Gold (1997).In the U.S., he has graced numerous weekly programs including Avvocati a Los Angeles (1986), Civil Wars (1991), and La signora in giallo (1984) and co-starred briefly with Robert Wagner and the late Samantha Smith in the action series Lime Street (1985), which ended abruptly with the young girl's death in a plane crash. The 13-year-old Smith became an instant celebrity after writing a touching and concerned letter to the then Soviet President Yuri Andropov about the relations between the two dominant powers and being invited to Russia.Into the millennium, the elderly Standing has remained extremely busy playing a number of distinguished lords and higher-ups, especially with British TV appearances (""The Vice,"" ""In Deep,"" ""Keen Eddie,"" ""MidSommer Murders,"" ""Game of Thrones,"" ""The Crown"") and in above-par TV movies and miniseries including Longitude (2000), Love in a Cold Climate (2001), The Falklands Play (2002), Guerra imminente (2002), Le miniere di re Salomone (2004), The Line of Beauty (2006), Fallen Angel (2007), L'altra moglie (2012), Patrick Melrose (2018) and King Lear (2018).Divorced from actress Jill Melford, Sir John's second wife, actress Sarah Forbes, is the daughter of director Bryan Forbes and actress Nanette Newman.","August 16, 1934 in London, England, UK",1934-08-16,"London, England, UK",,,,,"Sarah Forbes  (7 April 1984 - present) (3 children)

nm0822205,Arnold Stang,Arnold Stang,160,"A show-stopping comic for decades, the inimitable Arnold Stang, with the trademark Runyonesque voice and thick, black glasses, started out famously on radio before branching out to include Broadway, films and especially TV. Born on September 28, 1918, in New York City (for decades he himself perpetuated the myth of being born in 1925 in Chelsea, Massachusetts), he was the son of a lawyer. Following the 1929 stock market crash, his father was forced to look elsewhere for work and managed a living as a salesman. The scrawny kid from Manhatten grew up in Brooklyn and attended New Utrecht High School.During his teen years (early 1930s) he auditioned for and won roles on radio's ""Horn and Hardart's Children's Hour,"" a variety show, and the kiddie program ""Let's Pretend,"" which set off a two-decade stint as one of radio's most popular vocal personalities. His squawky, unmistakable voice was heard as Jughead in the ""Archie Andrews"" series and as neighbor Seymour Fingerhood on the beloved, Bronx-styled Gertrude Berg classic ""The Goldbergs,"" among others. He even appeared in radio soap operas and mysteries on occasion, often providing comedy relief. A reliable and feisty second banana, he traded quips with the best of them: Eddie Cantor; Jack Benny; Fred Allen; Fanny Brice; Milton Berle, you name it.In between radio work Stang could sometimes be seen on the stage, his first legitimate play being on Broadway with the short-lived ""All In Favour"" (1942). This was followed by ""You'll See Stars"" at the end of that same year. He subsequently moved from radio to TV with the help of Berle in the late 1940s and eventually found a very comfortable niche in comedy as a foil to the big stars. On the satirical Henry Morgan's Great Talent Hunt (1951), he was a regular member of Morgan's stock company as a nerdy teen named Gerard. Plain, plucky but rather sad-sack, his puny-looking nerd types (5'3"" and not much over 100 pounds) seemed to beg to have sand kicked in their faces. Yet, as much as they could be pushed around, they often displayed stubborn, delinquent-like streaks and could be mighty pesky in nature and irritating to the nth degree.Stang also lent his vocal talents quite successfully to cartoon voiceovers beginning with Popeye the Sailor's pal Shorty. He later moved into a lengthy hitch as ""Hoiman"" the mouse in Paramount's popular ""Herman and Katnip"" series, but his best known animal character, of course, came later with the title role in Joseph Barbera - William Hanna 1961 classic cartoon series Top Cat (1961). His playing of ""T.C"", the slick, smart-alecky, Brooklynesque mastermind behind a gang of alley cats, was very reminiscent of Phil Silvers' Sgt. Bilko character from The Phil Silvers Show (1955).Film work for Stang would be very sporadic over the years providing secondary but stalwart support in such escapism as Tre ragazze e un caporale (1942), Mia sorella Evelina (1942), Let's Go Steady (1945), Two Gals and a Guy (1951) and the all-star epic Questo pazzo, pazzo, pazzo, pazzo mondo (1963). Stang's best featured part was a rare dramatic role opposite Frank Sinatra in the then-daring topical movie about drug addiction entitled L'uomo dal braccio d'oro (1955). Here he played Sinatra's seedy but loyal pal Sparrow, a role that easily could have influenced Dustin Hoffman when he created his Ratso Rizzo character a decade and a half later in Un uomo da marciapiede (1969).From the 1950s, the bespectacled comedian would be a steadfast TV commercial spokesman pitching such products as Delco, Chunky candy (""Chunky...what a chunk o' chocolate!"") and Orkin (""Stop squawkin', call Orkin!"") using his own, unique style. As for the stage, a few of his later stints included the 1969 Broadway remake of ""The Front Page,"" the role of Hysterium in a production of ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and a part in Woody Allen's ""Play It Again, Sam"". The owlish comedian continued acting into the 90s with small roles in such movies as Papà è un fantasma (1990) and Dennis la minaccia (1993).Long married (since 1949) to wife JoAnn Taggart, a writer, Stang died of pneumonia at age 91 in Newton, Massachusetts, just before Christmas in 2009. He was also survived by his two children, David Donald and Deborah Jane.","September 28, 1918 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA",1918-09-28,"Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","December 20, 2009 in Newton, Massachusetts, USA  (pneumonia)",2009-12-20,"Newton, Massachusetts, USA  ",pneumonia,JoAnne Taggart  (21 September 1949 - 20 December 2009) (his death) (2 children),1,0,1,2

nm0822535,Kim Stanley,Patricia Beth Reid,,"Kim Stanley's movie roles were few and far between; she is perhaps best known for her stellar performances on stage, including successes on Broadway. But when she did step in front of the camera, nothing short of memorable resulted. Her repertoire in movies and on stage covered such diversity from the sensitive glamour-girl Rita Shawn character in the 1958 ""Goddess"" to the crusty, somewhat salty and sunbaked Pancho Barnes in 1983's Uomini veri (1983). Her abilities to play such diverse roles and play them well garnered her two Academy Award nominations: one for her portrayal of the slightly unhinged medium in the 1964 Ventimila sterline per Amanda (1964) and another for her characterization of the domineering and wrathful mother of Frances Farmer in 1982's Frances (1982). Stanley was born Patricia Reid in Tularosa, New Mexico. When her parents divorced, her mother moved the family, sans father, to Texas where her mother found work as an interior decorator. Drawn to both Texas and New Mexico, Stanley often found herself lonely and unsure of what she wanted. As a child, she wrote poetry and had many a daydream about becoming an artist or, on the other hand, a May Queen. In school, she found she liked acting in plays. At 16, in San Antonio she attended a touring production of ""The Philadelphia Story"", which starred Katharine Hepburn. recreating her role from the movie. Overwhelmed by the performance to the point of tears (she didn't want the play to end), Stanley aspired to do what she had seen Hepburn do. In college, she received a degree in psychology after attending first the University of New Mexico and subsequently, the University of Texas. But acting was still what she aspired to. So pursuing a career connected neither to her college major nor to the states where she grew up, Stanley eventually landed an acting apprenticeship in California with the Pasadena Playhouse. Her stay there was brief and she soon moved on to a winter stock company in Louisville, Kentucky. From there, with $21 to her name, she traveled to Manhattan. The year was 1947 and her Texas accent was still very much a part of her persona -- so much so that many in the New York theatre scene advised she go home to Texas. Persevering, however, Stanley made ends meet as a dress model and as a cocktail waitress, all the while honing her skills in off-Broadway productions of the Gertrude Stein ilk. It was in Stein's ""Yes Is for a Very Young Man,"" that New York Times theatre critic Books Atkinson singled out Stanley as an actress with promise (incidentally, he did not care much for the play she was in). Stanley was also developing her craft under the tutelage of Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York City, and scored her first Broadway success in 1952 when, at the age of 27, she played the 12-year-old Millie Owens in William Inge's ""Picnic"". Subsequently, in the 1954 production of Inge's ""Bus Stop,"" as the starry-eyed chanteuse Cherie (a role Marilyn Monroe assumed for the film), Stanley ascended to even greater heights and greater accolades in her acting achievements. Though she preferred stage acting to any other facsimile and often shied away from movies (reportedly, she declined to repeat for the movies roles she mastered on stage), she frequently played roles on television during the 1950s and '60s on such theatrical programs as ""Goodyear TV Playhouse"" and ""Magnavox Theater,"" garnering two Emmy awards in the process (one in 1963 for her contributions to an episode of Ben Casey (1961); the other for her Big Mama part in the 1984 PBS/American Playhouse production of Tennessee Williams' ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof""). In the latter part of her life, she gravitated toward teaching, conducting acting classes in Los Angeles and, later, returning to her roots, securing a position teaching acting at the College of Santa Fe in New Mexico.","February 11, 1925 in Tularosa, New Mexico, USA",1925-02-11,"Tularosa, New Mexico, USA","August 20, 2001 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA  (uterine cancer)",2001-08-20,"Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA  ",uterine cancer,"Joseph Siegel  (19 July 1964 - 1967) (divorced)

nm0822582,Richard Stanley,Richard Stanley,180,"Richard Stanley is the award-winning South African-born filmmaker, who made a name of himself with his first feature film, the sci-fi movie Hardware - Metallo letale (1990). A low budget movie about a mad-dog android loose in an apartment was released in 1990. Critics slammed it as a Terminator rip-off, yet the film became a financial success. The 1.5 million dollar budget was paid back quite handsomely and continuation was imminent.In 1992, Stanley followed Hardware with Demoniaca (1992), a story based on the myth of a Namibian serial killer. A fallout with the distributors led to the re-cutting of the US version, while the bankruptcy of the British-based production company Palace Pictures temporarily shut the post-production down in Europe and the film remained mauled or unfinished, depending how you look at it. Finally Stanley himself managed to finance a new, restored print from the original negative, which has later gained a cult following similar to Hardware.His third feature was to be L'isola perduta (1996), an adaptation of the famed H.G. Wells novel. Unfortunately it ended up a victim of creative disputes, leading to him being sacked a few days after production began. The finished film, released in 1996, carries little to no resemblance to the version he was originally set to make, using only about two words of his original script.This, however, hasn't beaten the visionary filmmaker down and horror movie fans are now waiting for him to come back... with a one mean vengeance.","November 22, 1966 in Fishhook, South Africa",1966-11-22,"Fishhook, South Africa",,,,,,0,0,0,0

It wasn't long before Chris and his younger twin brothers, Tony and Brian, began to shoot their own short movies. Chris further dabbled with performing at Griffin High School, where he was convinced by a teacher to audition for the theater club's latest production. He won the role and went on to play the lead in the musical, ""Carousel"", the following year. But it wasn't until college that Chris seriously considered a career in the entertainment business. In the fall of 1989, Stapleton received a full football scholarship to the University of Michigan. After starting as the team's punter his freshman year, he sustained a foot injury in training camp and was sidelined for the season. Frustrated, Chris focused his energy on acting. Throughout his college theater experience he was the lead in several productions including, ""The Time of Your Life"", ""As You Like It"", ""Andromache"" and the American classic, ""Our Town"". In 1993, he was named ""Performer of the Year"" by the Michigan Daily. Chris graduated from Michigan in '93 with a degree in Communications.

He became an animator by accident - fascinated by insects, he bought a camera and attempted to film them, but they kept dying under the hot lights. Stop-motion animation provided an instant (if slow) solution, and Starewicz discovered that he had a natural talent for it. He subsequently made dozens of short films, mostly featuring his trademark stop-motion puppets, but also live action films (some blending live action and animation), moving to France after the Russian Revolution to continue his career. His longest and most ambitious film was the feature-length 'Tale of the Fox', which took ten years to plan and eighteen months to shoot. Starewicz' films were virtually one-man shows (writer/director/cameraman/designer/animator), though other important contributions (in front of and behind the camera) were made by his daughters.","August 6, 1882 in Vilna, Russian Empire [now Vilnius, Lithuania]",1882-08-06,"Vilna, Russian Empire [now Vilnius, Lithuania]","February 28, 1965 in Fontenay-sous-Bois, Val-de-Marne, France  (undisclosed)",1965-02-28,"Fontenay-sous-Bois, Val-de-Marne, France  ",undisclosed,Anna Zimmerman  (25 November 1906 - 1956) (her death) (2 children),1,0,1,2

Her parents were Lora Evans and Goodlow Mullins. She had ten siblings. Blaze left home and moved to Washington, DC while only in her mid-teens. She was discovered by her first manager Red Snyder working as either a hat-check girl or at a donut shop. Starr got her stage name from Snyder, but, nonetheless, still left him after he attempted to rape her. With her fiery red hair, shapely and voluptuous 38D-24-37 figure, and sultry, energetic, and captivating stage presence (her stage routines included a comedic exploding coach gag and having a large trained black panther untie a ribbon on her costume, which made it fall to the floor), Blaze became a major headliner at the Two O'Clock Club in Baltimore, Maryland, and earned the nicknames ""Miss Spontaneous Combustion"" and ""The Hottest Blaze in Burlesque."" Starr made $1,500 dollars per week at the peak of her stripping career. Among the men's magazines she appeared in at the height of her fame are ""Sizzle,"" ""Ace,"" ""Scamp,"" ""Sir!,"" ""Best for Men,"" ""Rogue,"" and ""Modern Man."" Moreover, Starr posed for pictures for noted fetish photographer Irving Klaw. Blaze achieved her greatest notoriety in the late 1950s as the paramour for Louisiana state governor Earl Kemp Long (Earl Long); this affair inspired the 1989 feature film Scandalo Blaze (1989), which even has a cameo from Ms. Starr as a stripper. She portrayed herself in the immensely popular Doris Wishman nudie cutie romp Blaze Starr Goes Nudist (1962). In 1974, Starr wrote the autobiographical book ""Blaze Starr: My Life as Told to Huey Perry."" Blaze retired from stripping in 1983.

nm0823592,Ringo Starr,Richard Starkey,170,"Ringo Starr is a British musician, actor, director, writer, and artist best known as the drummer of The Beatles who also coined the title 'A Hard day's Night' for The Beatles' first movie.He was born Richard Starkey on July 7, 1940, in a small two-storey house in the working class area of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. His father, Richard Starkey, was a former dockworker turned baker; his mother, Elsie (Gleave) Starkey, was a bakery worker. His parents divorced when he was three and he and his mother, Elsie, moved to another home in Liverpool. While attending Silas Infants' Schools he suffered from many afflictions that basically ruined his education: he had constant abdominal pains, was once diagnosed with a ruptured appendix that led to an inflamed peritoneum, which also led to one of his first surgeries. Ringo was in a coma, and his recovery took a couple of months, during which more operations were performed, and he was known to be accident-prone. Shortly after he came out of the coma, he was trying to offer a toy bus to another boy in an adjoining bed, but fell and suffered from a concussion. When he finally was able to go back to school, he learned that he was far behind in his studies. At age 13 he caught a cold that turned into chronic pleurisy, causing him another stay at a hospital in Liverpool. A few lung complications followed, which resulted in a treatment in yet another children's hospital, this time until 1955. Meanwhile, Richard's mother Elsie had married Harry Graves, the man who her son referred to as a ""step-ladder"".At the age of 15 he could barely read or write, although he had aptitude for practical subjects such as woodwork and mechanics. At that time he dropped out of school and got his first job was as a delivery boy for British Rail. His second job was a barman on a ferry to New Brighton, and his next was as a trainee joiner at Henry Hunt & Sons. Ringo injured his finger on the first day of his new job, and then he decided to become a drummer. His dream came true, when his stepfather bought him a new drum kit, and Richard promised to be the best drummer ever.In 1957, together with Eddie Miles, he started his own band called 'Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group'. At that time he became known as Ritchie, and eventually became caught in the Liverpool's Skiffle craze. Although he was self-taught, he was a good time-keeper, and developed an original beat with his signature accentuations, due to his left-handed manner of playing on the right-handed drum set. He traveled from band to band, but he eventually landed a spot with ""Raving Texans"", which was a backing band for Rory Storm, later known as ""Rory Storm & The Hurricanes"", a popular band at that time Liverpool. Rory Storm encouraged Richard to enhance his career by legally changing his name to Ringo Starr. The Hurricanes topped the bill at one of Liverpool's clubs, where The Beatles also had a gig. Ringo's group was at times sharing popularity with The Beatles and Gerry and the Pacemakers. He wanted to leave The Hurricanes to join another group called ""The Seniors.""Before Ringo, The Beatles tried several other drummers. At one point they were so desperate, that they even invited strangers from the audience to fill the position. Then came Pete Best who was not considered by the other band members to be the greatest drummer, and they were keen to recruit Ringo as his replacement. On June 6, 1962, at the Abbey Road studios, The Beatles passed Martin's audition with the exception of Pete Best. George Martin liked them, but recommended the change of a drummer. Being asked by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison; Epstein fired Pete Best. After a mutual decision the band was completed with Ringo Starr. Ringo contributed to their first hit in September of 1962, when The Beatles recorded Love Me Do, which charted in UK, and reached the top of the US singles chart.Ringo's steady and reliable drumming became essential in their studio sessions, as well as in their numerous and exhausting live performances across the world. Ringo's positive disposition as well as his drumming style played the pivotal role in shaping the famous image and music style of The Beatles as they are now known to the world, under the management of Brian Epstein and music producer George Martin. Ringo filled the position of a drummer for The Beatles in the most critical time of the band's formation. He quickly connected with the other three members of The Beatles, and contributed to their music and creativity with his easy-going personality, light humour, reliable drumming and inventive musicianship. All four members were charismatic and individually talented artists, they sparked each other from the beginning. Eventually they made a much better group effort under the thorough management by Brian Epstein whose coaching helped consolidate their talents and mutual stimulation into beautiful teamwork.Starr had dreamed of becoming a professional actor since his younger years. He wanted to be in movies probably more so than the other members of The Beatles. In 1964, during the first months of Beatlemania, Ringo coined the phrase 'A Hard Day's Night' which soon became the official title of the Beatles' first movie, in replacement for the working title 'Beatlemania'. Ringo received great reviews for his performance in Tutti per uno (1964) and Aiuto! (1965). At first, Ringo did not have a songwriting career, although he had no problem with his name recognition, however, he had a problem with getting his songs noticed. At that time he got help from his friends; John and Paul wrote a song or two for him to sing on their albums, such as ""Boys"", ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", ""Honey Don't"", and ""Yellow Submarine"". During his eight-year career with The Beatles, Ringo wrote two original songs: ""Don't Pass Me By"" and ""Octopus' Garden"" for which he also sang the lead vocals. Besides his drumming, Ringo's voice was recorded on many of the most popular Beatle's songs, contributing to their unique sound and tight harmonies.He had a hectic solo career during the 1970s, after the breakup of The Beatles. However, Ringo eventually emerged as a steady performer, and sustained a very popular solo career, turning out a dozen chart-topping hit songs and eight best-selling albums. He made a famous appearance together with George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, and other popular musicians in the landmark 'Concert for Bangladesh' in 1971. His 1973 solo release ""Ringo"" was the last album to feature all four living Beatles, although not on the same song. He also appeared in various TV shows, including his own special, Ringo (1978), and a TV mini-series, La principessa Daisy (1983), with his wife Barbara. In 1984 he did narration for the children's series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends (1984). During the 1980s, after having a long period of troubles with alcohol, Ringo and his wife attended a rehabilitation clinic, and came back to the scene sober. He made the All-Starr Band tour of America and Japan. The tour was so popular that he formed another All-Starr Band lineup in 1992, and began an American and European tour in June of that year. Since then Ringo Starr has been enjoying a continuous career as the leader of the All-Starr Band. In 1994, along with George Harrison and Paul McCartney, the three surviving members of The Beatles, reunited and produced Lennon's previously unknown song 'Free as a Bird'. It was preserved by 'Yoko Ono' on a tape recording made by John Lennon in 1977. The song was re-arranged and re-mixed with the voices of three surviving members, and became an international hit. 'Free as a Bird' was also included in The Beatles Anthology TV documentary which was watched by 420 million people in 1995. Ringo, Paul and George sang their new songs, in addition to mixing their voices and music arrangements to John Lennon demos.Ringo's old friend and band-mate George Harrison passed away on November 29, 2001, after a long battle against lung cancer. The following year, on the anniversary of Harrison's death, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton appeared in a Concert For George, to raise money for the support of Harrison's legacy in exploration of alternative lifestyles, views and philosophies. Starr also supported charitable organizations with consideration to those who have special needs.Ringo Starr updated the role of a drummer in popular music, he made drummer an equal partner to the lead musicians, thus changing the whole paradigm in how the public saw drummers. His original performing style evolved from adjusting his natural left-handed manner of playing to the right-handed drum set, and allowing his left hand lead in weaving a pattern tightly intertwined with the music of other players, and adding such enhancements as unusual accents and stops. Ringo's musical originality as well as his inventive drumming patterns, time signatures and accentuations became essential to the sound of The Beatles. His on-stage presence and acting talent as well as his humor and musicianship was the essential part in formation and remarkable career of The Beatles.He was married to his long-time girlfriend, Maureen Cox, from 1965 - 1975, and they had three children: Zak Starkey, Jason, and Lee. The couple broke up in July of 1975, and he married actress Barbara Bach.

nm0823630,Jack Starrett,Claude Ennis Starrett Jr.,178,"Jack Starrett was a superbly talented and versatile actor and director who specialized in making hugely enjoyable down-'n'-dirty low-budget drive-in exploitation pictures. Starrett was born on November 2, 1936, in Refugio, TX. He attended San Marcos Academy in the 1940s and the 1950s. He made his acting debut as ""Coach Jennings"" in Giovani iene (1961) and his debut as a director with two superior biker features starring legendary B-movie tough guy William Smith: Corri, Angel, corri! (1969) and The Losers (1968). The latter movie proved to be highly influential to subsequent action films made in the 1980s; its ""bring the boys back home"" Vietnam prisoners of war rescue operation premise was reused in such 1980s features as Fratelli nella notte (1983), Rombo di tuono (1984) and Rambo 2 - La vendetta (1985). His follow-up films Guerriero rosso (1970) and Una maledetta piccola squaw (1972) were both regrettably mediocre, but Starrett bounced back with the exciting Jim Brown blaxploitation vehicle Slaughter - Uomo mitra (1972) and the delightful Cleopatra Jones: licenza di uccidere (1973). I fratelli Dion (1974) was an amiable tongue-in-cheek crime caper romp, while the terrific devil worship/car chase/horror/action winner In corsa con il diavolo (1975) was Starrett's biggest ever drive-in hit and one of his most well-regarded movies. Caccia aperta (1976) was a solid entry in the popular redneck exploitation genre that was hot in the 70s. Kiss My Grits (1982) rates as one of his most atypical and underrated films; it's a really sweet and low-key character study of two likable cowpokes. In addition to his film work, Starrett also directed episodes of such TV shows as Hill Street giorno e notte (1981), A-Team (1983), Hazzard (1979), Supercar (1982), Planet of the Apes (1974) and Starsky & Hutch (1975).Big and burly, with a rough, ruddy complexion, thinning hair, a thick, furry mustache and a deep, booming, resonant rumble of a gravely voice, Jack Starrett had an extremely strong and commanding screen presence that he put to exceptionally fine use as an actor. Starrett was hilarious as the unintelligible old-timer ""Gabby Johnson""--a take-off on iconic western sidekick George 'Gabby' Hayes--in Mezzogiorno e mezzo di fuoco (1974) and gave an outstanding performance as ""Galt"", the mean small-town deputy who ruthlessly antagonizes Sylvester Stallone in the fantastic Rambo (1982). Starrett was likewise memorable as strict factory foreman ""Swick"" in Il fiume dell'ira (1984), and in addition often took small roles in his own pictures.He was married to soap opera actress Valerie Starrett. Their daughter, Jennifer Starrett, was also an actress. Alas, Jack Starrett had problems with alcoholism, which led to his tragic and untimely death at age 52 from kidney failure on March 27, 1989.","November 2, 1936 in Refugio, Texas, USA",1936-11-02,"Refugio, Texas, USA","March 27, 1989 in Sherman Oaks, California, USA  (kidney failure)",1989-03-27,"Sherman Oaks, California, USA  ",kidney failure,"Karen M.

nm0823633,Charles Starrett,Charles Robert Starrett,188,"While on the Darmouth College football team, Charles Starrett was hired to play a football extra in The Quarterback (1926). Impressed by the job, Starrett got the acting bug and next went into vaudeville, then regional stage work and finally to Broadway. Spotted by a Paramount talent scout, Starrett was signed to play the romantic lead in Fast and Loose (1930). For the next couple of years he would be busy, but his roles were unremarkable. In 1933 he would be one of the people who helped organize the Screen Actors Guild. In 1936 he would sign with Columbia and over the next 16 years star in 115 westerns. Appearing in as many films as he did, he was usually called ""Steve"" something - such was life on the ""B"" circuit. During the 1940s Starrett would always be among the top ten western stars. After playing assorted sheriffs and rangers, he would become well known for his role as the ""Durango Kid"". Never ask where he kept the white horse and the clothes, but he could change outfits and horses before the gun could clear the leather. The Durango Kid first appeared in 1940, and towards the end of his career he would play the Durango Kid in almost every film, even though he was starting to show his age. When the ""B"" movie westerns rode off into the sunset in the early 1950s, Starrett hung up his spurs for good.","March 28, 1903 in Athol, Massachusetts, USA",1903-03-28,"Athol, Massachusetts, USA","March 22, 1986 in Borrego Springs, California, USA  (cancer)",1986-03-22,"Borrego Springs, California, USA  ",cancer,Mary McKinnon  (1927 - 22 March 1986) (his death) (2 children),1,0,1,2

nm0824332,Myrtle Stedman,Myrtle Stedman,168,"Born in Chicago in 1885, silent screen actress Myrtle Stedman's (née Lincoln) musical talents developed quite early, finding herself on stage at age 12 singing light opera in the chorus. She had progressed to singing leads in shows by the time she decided to abandon her music career altogether for the movies. She and actor-husband Marshall Stedman were signed by the Selig Polyscope Co. in 1911 and Myrtle's first credit was The Two Orphans (1911), a three-reeler. She was often directed or paired up with Marshall during those early years, but Myrtle was the one who stood out with moviegoers. Known as ""the girl with the pearly eyes,"" she was not only an adorably enchanting and enigmatic presence in film drama, her athletic abilities also complemented westerns and action adventures. She moved to the Bosworth Company in 1914 and appeared in such noteworthy silents as The Country Mouse (1914), Jane (1915), Peer Gynt (1915), and, most notably, the classic Hypocrites (1915), the last helmed by pioneer lady director Lois Weber. She increased her reputation as a fine actress with The American Beauty (1916), As Men Love (1917), In the Hollow of Her Hand (1918) and The Teeth of the Tiger (1919). Her son, Lincoln Stedman, made his debut as a juvenile player about this time. Following her rich roles in Reckless Youth (1922) and The Famous Mrs. Fair (1923), which was considered one of her finest, her star began to fade. Her marriage also fell apart. As she regressed into support work, she was able to maintain, however, while others of her acting level fell completely by the waste side. Myrtle suffered a heart attack in late 1937 and declined quickly, dying on January 8, 1938 at age 52.

However, her first professional engagements were as an assistant stage manager, working behind the scenes in a somewhat lowly capacity, because, she says, she was not considered conventionally pretty enough to be an actress. She does, however, recall that the eccentric English puppeteer Harry Corbett praised her for assisting him with his creation Sooty the Bear. Maggie left theatrical life after only a few months and for several years worked as a secretary. An interest in Theatre in Education lured her back to the stage, this time as an actress, with Sue Johnston and Clive Russell at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry. Since then she has worked on stage with both the Royal Shakespeare and National Theatre Companies, and in 2002 was a commanding Lady Bracknell in a revival of 'The Importance of Being Earnest'. A lady of political awareness, she was a founder member of the Campaign Against Racism in the Media, and in the early 1980s visited Nicaragua with actor Andy de la Tour to view the plight of its citizens, and in 1983, helped stage the televised Concert for Nigaragua.

Her initial desire to develop theatre for and with children prompted her to seek a career as an actress and a teacher. From 1984 to 1988 she attended the school of acting at Arnhem to become a stage actress. Considering acting ""the language of the heart"", one of the most important things she learned was that the personnel and creative development of an actor are closely knit. Her acting experience ranges from Shakespeare, Sophocles, Strindberg and Chekhov to improvisory clown acts.At the academy, collaboration with fellow students resulted in the very successful theatre group ""De Trust"", directed by Boermans. In 1987 Johanna was asked for a role in the film Il mistero della donna scomparsa (1988) (A.K.A. ""The Vanishing""), directed by George Sluizer. This role met international acclaim, winning her the ""Felix Award"" (Best Supporting Actress) in Berlin.Inevitably, her career shifted from the theatre to the cinema. For the past twelve years she has traveled all over the world, acting in different languages and working with renowned directors, such as Robert Altman (Vincent & Theo (1990)), István Szabó (Dolce Emma, cara Bobe (1992), A.K.A.

nm0824377,Ingrid Steeger,Ingrid Anita Stengert,159,"Ingrid Steeger was born Ingrid Anita Stengert in Berlin, April 1st, 1947, as the third child to Kurt and Käthe Stengert, who already had son Udo and daughter Jutta. After school she worked as a secretary when she was discovered by photographer Frank Quade. Soon pinup photos of her appeared in numerous men's magazines, especially SEXY, where even today she is the girl with the most cover shots. She was elected Miss Filmfestival (Berlin 1968) and soon was into movies herself. Her early movies were cheap sex movies, mostly of the ""Report"" type. Not wanting to use her real name, because her father objected, and not yet having decided on a stage name, her first movie billed her as ""Ingrid Stengel"".Her ""very"" first movie deserves a special mention. Before the age of video, pornos for home viewing were Super 8 shorts and Ingrid starred uncredited in one of those, called ""Die perverse Herrin und ihre Opfer"" (""The perverted Mistress and her Victims""). This movie had long been forgotten, when at the height of her career Mike Hunter reissued it on video, retitled ""Ingrid Steeger's Porno Action"". She went to court to stop distribution and won. The same thing happened again when Beate Uhse distributed a collection of old naturalist shots of Ingrid, titled ""Ingrid - blutjung und verführerisch"" (""Ingrid - youngblooded and tempting""). Again she had to go to court to stop distribution. In addition to her movies, she was given small serious roles in TV-productions, where, strange as it seems, nobody seemed to know about her sex-films. Helmut Holger, one of her colleagues suggested her to director Michael Pfleghar, who was casting for a new TV comedy series called ""Klimbim"", a German version of the American show ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh In"". This show became her breakthrough. The public loved her in her new role as ""Klimbim-clown"", and decent pictures of her appeared in women's and teen's magazines. The readers of Germany's biggest teen magazine BRAVO awarded her the ""Otto"", BRAVO's top award, four times. (1975: Bronze, 1976 & 1977: Silver, 1978: Gold). It seemed that nobody could stop her now. She followed ""Klimbim"" with ""Zwei himmlische Töchter"" (""Two Heavenly Daughters""), another successful comedy series, and flopped badly with ""Susi"", a third one, all directed by Pfleghar. From then on it was downhill for her. She went to France to live with her actor-friend Jean-Paul Zehnacker, but they soon separated. Ingrid returned to Germany to become a mature, serious actress, in the vein of her idols Shirley MacLaine or Goldie Hawn, but the public wouldn't let her. The same public that once had forgiven her sexfilm-past wouldn't forget ""Klimbim"", though the series hadn't been shown for ages. Nearly every article on her began with ""Ingrid Steeger, ex-clown (""Klimbim""), will ..."". Michael Pfleghar couldn't help her either, because he ran into severe personal problems and committed suicide a few years later. Though Ingrid can act, her few serious roles were doomed from the start. In recent years she has concentrated on theater and played mostly boulevard comedies. In 1995 she starred in the Karl May summer theater in Bad Segeberg as Cowgirl Mona. Her private life has been rather chaotic too. Her marriages, liaisons and affairs are well chronicled and are always listed when she is seen with somebody new. 1) When starting in the movies she married cameraman Lothar Stickelbrucks in 1973, but they got divorced two years later. 2) She had an affair with director Michael Pfleghar, though neither one admitted it at that time. She even wanted to leave Germany to go to Hollywood with him (Rumour?). 3) Next was Peter Koenecke, who organized safari tours in Kenia. They planned to marry in 1979 and to move to Kenia together. Allegedly she even learned Swahili. 4) Next was French actor Jean-Paul Zehnacker, who starred with her in ""Susi"". She moved to live with him in France, but when love turned to frienship she returned to Germany 1984. 5) Next was Lothar Köllner (1985-1986), owner of a hifi-shop in Murnau, and she even obtained her driver's license at the age of 38 to see him more often. 6) Next was movie director Dr. Dieter Wedel (1988-1991), whom she shared with another woman. At least he starred her in his TV-series ""Wilder Westen inklusive"" and ""Der große Bellheim"", giving her a chance for some serious acting. 7) Then she met Red Indian Dakota Tom LaBlanc at a World Uranium Hearing and they got married in a rush in August 1992. Nobody gave them much of a chance, because Tom didn't speak German and she didn't speak much English. Most photos show them side by side, Tom having to wear Red Indian clothing with feather headdress for the photographers, holding Ingrid's dachshund and looking very uneasy. Nevertheless the press never accepted him. The couple was always referred to as ""Ingrid and her Indian"". Soon he spend most of his time in America, fighting for the rights of his people, and Ingrid was left at home. They divorced after three years in October 1995. 8) Next was Swiss actor Bernd Seebacher. Immediately following her divorce from Tom LaBlanc she fell in love with Bernd and August 1996 was set as the date for the wedding. The couple was shown in magazines, choosing rings and posing in their wedding dresses, but in the last possible moment the wedding was postponed. Unfortunately Ingrid had already sold her apartment in Munich to live with her husband in Switzerland. Now that she remained a foreigner, she had to leave the country. Her only true friend in all those years was her dachshund Felix. There is scarcely one private photo of Ingrid without her dog. When Felix was killed in France by a hit-and-run driver, she mourned a long time and finally got Felix II. This one even went on stage with her in ""Champagner-Complex"" and was said to have been the matchmaker when she first met Dieter Wedel. When Felix II had to be put to sleep in 1995, she didn't want another one, but Dieter Wedel kept up the tradition by presenting her a young dachshund called Lucky Luke.","April 1, 1947 in Berlin, Germany",1947-04-01,"Berlin, Germany",,,,,"Tom LaBlanc  (17 August 1992 - 17 October 1995) (divorced)

Barbara is loved by her fans for her talent, intelligence, and a dark mysterious beauty that is unique; her face epitomizes either sweet innocence, or malign evil (she is wonderful to watch either way). At first, Barbara studied to become a painter. In 1957, she joined an acting repertory company. Her feature acting debut was in the British comedy Uno straniero a Cambridge (1958). At age 21, this strikingly lovely lady, with the hauntingly beautiful face, large eyes, sensuous lips and long dark hair got her breakout role by starring in La maschera del demonio (1960), the quintessential Italian film about witchcraft (it was the directorial debut for cinematographer Mario Bava; with his background, it was exquisitely photographed and atmospheric).We got to see Barbara, but did not hear her; her voice was dubbed by another actress for international audiences. After its American success, AIP brought Barbara to America, to star in Roger Corman's Il pozzo e il pendolo (1961); (though the film was shot entirely in English, again Barbara's own voice was not used). By now, Barbara was typecast by American audiences as a horror star. In 1962, she answered an open-casting call and won a role in Federico Fellini's 8½ (1963); she only had a small role, but it was memorable. Reportedly, Fellini wanted to use her more in the film, but she was contracted to leave Rome to start work on her next horror movie, L'orribile segreto del Dr. Hichcock (1962). Being a slow and meticulous director, Fellini's 8½ (1963) was not released until 1963. (Later, when Barbara was cast in lesser roles in lesser movies, she would tell the directors: ""I've worked with some of the best directors in the world. I've worked with Fellini!"")More horror movies followed, such as Lo spettro (1963), Danza macabra (1964), Un angelo per Satana (1966) and others; this success lead to her being typecast in the horror genre, where she more often than not appeared in Italian movies with a dubbed voice. The nadir was appearing in Black Horror - Le messe nere (1968), which was mainly eye candy, with scantily-clad women in a cult. Unfortunately, Barbara got sick of being typecast in horror movies. One of the screen's greatest horror stars, she said in an interview: ""I never want to climb out of another freakin' coffin again!"" This was sad news for her legion of horror fans; it was also a false-step for Barbara as far as a career move. Back in America, she met screenwriter James Poe; they got married, and remained together for many years.James Poe wrote an excellent role for Barbara in Non si uccidono così anche i cavalli? (1969). The role ended up going to Susannah York, and Barbara wouldn't act in movies again for five years. Barbara returned to movies in Femmine in gabbia (1974); she was miscast: a few years before, Barbara would have been one of the beautiful inmates, not the wheelchair-bound warden, but her performance won positive reviews. In 1977, she appeared in a film by Roger Corman, based on the true story of a mentally ill woman, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (1977). Unfortunately, her scenes wound up on the cutting room floor. Barbara appeared in Pretty Baby (1978), but she was in the background the whole time, and her talents were mostly wasted. Barbara would appear in two more unmemorable movies. She and James Poe got divorced in 1978, he died two years later.Barbara appeared in the independent film The Silent Scream (1979). Maybe because her ex-husband was now dead, or because her acting career was going nowhere, Barbara retired from acting for a decade. However, she had a great deal of success as a producer. She was an associate producer for the miniseries Venti di guerra (1983), and produced Ricordi di guerra (1988), for which she got an Emmy Award. Her horror fans were delighted when Barbara showed up again, this time on television in Dark Shadows (1991), a revival of the beloved 1960s supernatural soap opera. And she has developed a relative fondness along with a sense of ironic humor about her horror queen status, which was evident in her appearance in Clive Barker's documentary A-Z of Horror (1997). The still-lovely Barbara acts occasionally, her latest film was The Butterfly Room - La stanza delle farfalle (2012). Even well past 60, Barbara Steele is still beautiful and her fans still love her.","December 29, 1937 in Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, UK",1937-12-29,"Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, UK",,,,,James Poe  (1969 - 1978) (divorced) (1 child),1,1,1,1

She was born in Reno, Nevada on August 27, 1930 in a log cabin built by her father, a contractor. Her mother was part Russian and Swedish while her father came from German and Sioux Indian parentage. Marjorie's family moved to San Francisco when she was 9. It was here that she took an interest in acting while still young. She started with acting lessons and eventually won a scholarship to the Actors Lab in Hollywood.To support herself in the early days, she worked as a cigarette girl at Ciro's, L.A.'s top nightclub. In what was to become a Cinderella story, the working teenager attracted the attention of multimillionaire Huntington Hartford. Smitten, Hartford not only signed her to a contract with a motion picture company he owned, he married her in 1949--shortly after her nineteenth birthday. She built up her reputation on stage and appeared in two films produced by her husband: Hello Out There (1949) and Uomini senza paura (1952).Her other two ""B"" films were Tough Assignment (1949) and No Escape (1953). Marjorie scored well in theater assignments, notably as the title role in ""Sabrina Fair"" in 1954, which played in London, and on Broadway when she took over the role of Maggie the Cat from Barbara Bel Geddes in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."" Shortly after this, she suddenly lost interest in her career and decided to retire and raise a family.She married British actor Dudley Sutton following her 1961 divorce to Hartford, with whom she had two children,, but the marriage lasted only a few years. Her daughter by this marriage predeceased her mother, dying of a drug overdose at age 28.

Stein originally wanted to be an Egyptologist, but shifted his interest to music after his parents bought him his first guitar at age 11. Chris attended P.S. 199 for grades one through six, went to junior high school at Andres Hudde, and was kicked out of Midwood High School during his junior year in 1965 for having long hair. (He finished high school at the Quintanos School for Young Professionals.) In the early '70s, Stein joined the glam-rock group the Stilettos, which featured Debbie Harry as its lead singer. After the Stilettos fell apart, Stein and Harry formed the hugely popular and successful punk/New Wave band Blondie. Stein wrote the hit song ""Sunday Girl,"" plus co-wrote with his one-time girlfriend Harry such Blondie songs as their breakthrough disco smash ""Heart of Glass,"" ""Dreaming,"" ""Rapture,"" ""Picture This,"" ""Rip Her to Shreds,"" and ""Island of Lost Souls."" He ran the label Animal Records from 1982 to 1984. In 1982, Blondie broke up, mainly because Stein was diagnosed with a rare and often fatal skin disease, pemphigus. Stein eventually made a full recovery after a long battle with this illness. He not only composed the scores for the films Union City (1980) and Pie in the Sky: The Brigid Berlin Story (2000), but also was a co-composer on the scores for the movie Wild Style (1982) and the TV special When Disco Ruled the World (2005). In the late '90s, Stein and Harry relaunched Blondie; the group has recorded two albums and continues to perform in concert all over the world. Stein is also a longtime photographer; his pictures have been used as album artwork by Lydia Lunch and Dramarama.

The family moved to Chicago when he was a teen. It was there that he saw a performance by the Second City Chicago Troupe and it changed the course of his life. With another student at the university, he started a comedy act called Kadish and Steinberg. After members of Second City saw them, he was invited to join the company and was with them for four years. In the late 60's he moved on to Broadway with leading roles in ""Little Murders"" and ""Carry Me Back to Morningside Heights"", the latter directed by Sidney Poitier. From there he moved to stand up comedy opening at the Bitter End in 1969. He received a rave review from the New York times, calling him a cross between Lenny Bruce and Woody Allen. After his first appearance on the The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), he became one of Johnny Carson's most popular guests and guest hosts, with 140 appearances, second only to Bob Hope. He wrote and performed for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (1967) where his irreverent ""sermons"" were often censored and cited as the reason for the show's cancellation.Steinberg's sometimes racy, usually anti-establishment stance of the late 60s/early 70s made him a favorite among the young and disillusioned. Steinberg released four solo comedy albums and CBS gave him his own summer comedy variety series with The David Steinberg Show (1972). In 1976, Steinberg returned to Canada to create and star in another series, also called _'The David Steinberg Show'. Gary Shandling credits this show as being one of the influences for _The Larry Sanders Show(1992)_. It featured John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Martin Short and Dave Thomas who went on to form the legendary SCTV troupe.In 1982 Steinberg made his directorial debut with the feature Paternity (1981) and, the following year, his TV directorial debut with an episode of Bravo Dick (1982). In the 90s, he became the executive producer of the popular CBS-TV Quattro donne in carriera (1986) and continued to direct. Other TV credits as director include episodes of Cuori senza età (1985), Seinfeld (1989) , Innamorati pazzi (1992), Weeds (2005), and Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000).

Rob spent the 80s in New York in ""the music biz"" -- and for what he can remember was involved in marketing, promotion, and management with such noted acts as Scorpions, War and Bob Marley. Rob switched careers and coasts after a near-fatal car accident, moved to Los Angeles and embarked on a second career, focusing his sites on the film business -- a decision his mom blames on the head injury from that car accident!Within the first six months, his breakthrough role came in 58 minuti per morire - Die Harder (1990) as the assistant to Bill Atherton's obnoxious TV reporter. Since then, Rob has worked with and is about to drop the names of such noted Hollywood luminaries as Joel Silver, Lawrence Gordon, Renny Harlin, Barbet Schroeder, Jonathan Kaplan, Mimi Leder, Jim Carey, Denzel Washington, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russell and Academy Award winners Delbert Mann & George Clooney. Rob has appeared in twenty films including the blockbusters Abuso di potere (1992), Inserzione pericolosa (1992) and Verdetto finale (1991) while starring in mediocre films such as Casa Hollywood (1996), Staying on Top (2001), Resolution (2001) and the unbelievably schlocky Kraa! - Il mostro marino (1998). Rob has appeared in a whole bunch of network television shows when network was the thing, including Streghe (1998), Melrose Place (1992), recurred as Dr. Webb on Beautiful (1987). On stage, Rob won a Virgo Award as male lead in ""Whispers of an Asian Bride"", a Telly Award in 2004 for an Academic Short produced by Publishers Media and a local area Emmy Award in 2002 starring in a UPN/FOX spot called ""Bad Day.""Rob produced the feature films Resolution (2001) and In a Dark Place (2005). He co-wrote a six-part children's series with Scholastic Video called ""Posie Paints"" playing several characters and voicing the lead -- an animated pigeon. Rob and John Cleese starred together on several national radio spots. Rob claims to be adept with improvisation, impressions, dialects and can burp the alphabet -- and performed stand-up at the Improv and Second City. Rob's production company, Scarlet Fire Entertainment, has created a half-hour television pilot called Par for the Course -- it's ""Cheers"" meets ""Tin Cup"", and an animated feature called Birds of a Feather, where rival gangs of pigeons battle over territory and racial prejudice in New York's Central Park -- think ""West Side Story"" with pigeons -- but without all that death and stuff. Currently, Rob has written and is developing Tell It Like It Is, a romantic comedy set in New Orleans as well as a one-hour series of about graphic Rock n' Roll from his days in the music biz called, It's Ok. I'm with the Band or These Are Not the Droids You Want! A book of those bizarre tales is also underway. Rob anxiously awaits the day when all of his ambitions are realized and he can escort his mother to the Oscars -- but his mother is still hoping and praying that his head injury will heal!","April 26, 1959 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA",1959-04-26,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0825952,John Steiner,John Steiner,188,"This tall, blond, thin British character actor portrayed some of the most memorable villains of Italian cinema during the 1970s and 1980s. Born in Cheshire county England in 1941, Steiner got his start in films after school with small parts in British productions. Among them was 'The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade' (1966), Il mio amico il diavolo (1967), and Work is a 4-Letter Word (1968).His big break came in portraying the sly-eyed, manipulative property tycoon Beauty Smith in Lucio Fulci's _Zanna Bianca (1972)_ (White Fang) in 1973, a role he re prised in the sequel, Il ritorno di Zanna Bianca (1974) (Challenge to White Fang) in 1974. Steiner worked for Fulci again in playing the comical vampire Count Dragalescu in Il cav. Costante Nicosia demoniaco, ovvero: Dracula in Brianza (1975), in which he was both horrifying and hilarious as a homosexual Count Dracula vamp.Steiner continued working in Italy through the 1970s, dabbling in some of the country's most controversial entertainments. He demonstrated an entirely un-British willingness to embrace the wild side of acting life by accepting a role as a Nazi officer in Rino Di Silvestro's Le deportate della sezione speciale SS (1976). This set the sage for a series of roles as Nazi prison camp officers filmed in West Germany. Steiner made a similar themed role in Tinto Brass' Salon Kitty (1976) and later signed up for a role in Caligola (1979), in which he was a standout, playing the balding, gauntly hideous-looking treasurer and financial advisor, Longinus, to the mad Roman Emperor Caligula (played by 'Malcom McDowell' ). After a commendable performance in Paolo Cavara's 1976 thriller 'Plot of Fear', came 'Schock', the last theatrical film directed by Mario Bava. Steiner's rare starring role in Shock (1977) was a nice change of pace for him as he played a sympathetic airline pilot and family man appearing alongside Daria Nicolodi. After that, he went back to tall and menacing looking villainous roles one of which occurred when Dario Argento hired him to appear as the eccentric Italian film journalist Christiano Berti in Tenebre (1982) which remains Steiner's most celebrated film credit in which he meets with a most memorable end with an ax to his head midway through.As the business of Italian cinema diminished during the 1980s, Steiner's roles in Italian and West German productions were nothing more than brief cameos. One notable role was playing Simon the Magnes in the TV mini-series A.D. (1985). By the early 1990s Steiner had quit the acting industry and moved to Los Angeles, California, USA with his wife and teenage son where he became a successful real estate agent working out of Beverly Hills.","January 7, 1941 in Chester, Cheshire, England, UK",1941-01-07,"Chester, Cheshire, England, UK",,,,,,0,0,0,0

Steinmann was a production associate on Arthur Hiller's The Man in the Glass Booth (1975) and served as an associate producer on the offbeat Gene Roddenberry made-for-TV supernatural fright feature Spectre (1977). In addition, Danny headed a production company in Puerto Rico that made TV commercials for such companies as International House of Pancakes, Chase Manhattan Bank and Wesson Oil.Danny directed and co-wrote the perverse psycho horror winner The Unseen (1980). Dissatisfied with the finished version of the film, Steinmann attributed his directorial credit to the pseudonym Peter Foleg. He followed this film with the terrifically trashy teen exploitation action/revenge thriller doozy Savage Streets (1984). Steinmann hit the relative big time with the mean-spirited slice-'n'-dice sequel Venerdì 13: il terrore continua (1985). Although the movie was a financial success, the production was very troubled and proved to be his cinematic swan song. He was announced as the director for a proposed sequel to the notorious L'ultima casa a sinistra (1972) but, alas, this project never came to be.","January 7, 1942 in New York City, New York, USA",1942-01-07,"New York City, New York, USA","December 18, 2012 in Los Angeles, California, USA  (undisclosed)",2012-12-18,"Los Angeles, California, USA  ",undisclosed,,0,0,0,0

The original soundtrack was recorded in multiple locations with a stellar group of 35 musicians.""SHAKESPEARE BEHIND BARS"" is a testimony to his deep commitment to a project he believes in. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize. It is a powerful look at crime and punishment, forgiveness and redemption - all brought about by a prison production of Shakespeare's Tempest.""BUKOWSKI: BORN INTO THIS"" (also a Sundance Grand Jury Prize nominee) is a rare and piercing look into the complex heart and soul of a literary iconoclast, whose work continues to resonate with each succeeding generation through its clarity and truth.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0826479,Anna Sten,Anna Sten,,"Born in Russia to a Ukrainian father and a Swedish mother, Anna Sten studied at the Russian Film Academy and joined the Moscow Art Theater. Strikingly beautiful, she went on to appear in a number of Russian silent films, but it was in the German film Il delitto Karamazov (1931) that Anna gained notice. Samuel Goldwyn saw a picture of Anna in the paper and rushed to view the film. After the first reel he sent word to sign her, hoping to develop her into a star of the magnitude of Greta Garbo or Marlene Dietrich. His agent did sign Anna to a contract but forgot to mention the fact that Anna didn't speak a word of English, which made her appearance in sound pictures questionable. She spent a year studying English every day and working out makeup and acting. Goldwyn publicity called her ""The Passionate Peasant"" and sold her image to papers all over America. However, her first picture, Nanà (1934), even though almost completely rewritten and reshot from the original, didn't bring audiences into the theaters. While Anna was looked great, the script and picture were average. Her second film, Resurrezione (1934), marginally better suited to her style, also died within weeks at the box office. After her third film for Goldwyn, Notte di nozze (1935), also flopped, she and Goldwyn parted company after it became known around Hollywood as ""Goldwyn's Last Sten."" Anna made a few more movies, but by the end of the decade she was forgotten.","December 3, 1908 in Kiev, Russian Empire [now Ukraine]",1908-12-03,"Kiev, Russian Empire [now Ukraine]","November 12, 1993 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA  (cardiac arrest)",1993-11-12,"Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA  ",cardiac arrest,"Eugene Frenke  (1932 - 10 March 1984) (his death)

nm0826594,Katherine Stenholm,Katherine Corne,,"In 36 years she directed 72 productions including sermon films, promotional films, multi-image presentations, and feature-length films. In 1950, Katherine Stenholm was directing a stage play of ""Cyrano"" when she was approached by Dr. Bob Jones Sr., founder of Bob Jones University, Greenville, SC, to take on the task of starting a Cinema Department for the school. She was surprised as his request since she had no experience in film, but continued on to gain an in-depth education in filmmaking, both in graduate study at USC and through contacts made within the industry. Peter Mole, founder of Mole-Richardson Co., provided all the lighting needs for the new studio built on the campus, called ""Unusual Films."" After directing a number of short ministry films for evangelist Dr. Bob Jones Sr., Katherine Stenholm swung into the feature length production of ""Wine of Morning."" This film is based upon a novel written by Dr. Bob Jr., a reinvention of the story of Barabbas, the murderer chosen to be released in place of Jesus, right before the crucifixion. In 1955, ""Wine of Morning"" won the National Evangelical Film Foundation awards for best film, best director, best actor, and best producer of the year. This was also selected by the University Film Producers Association (now University Film and Video Association) to represent the United States at the International Film Festival in Cannes, France for a meeting of the International Congress of Motion Picture and Television Schools in 1958. Katherine Stenholm was one of the keynote speakers at the Cannes Festival and later gave a keynote address at the International Congress of Motion Picture and Television Schools held in Paris soon after. In addition to her teaching responsibilities, she continued to run the Unusual Films' studios until 1986. Film students gained a distinct advantage under her guidance as she held high standards of filmmaking. All students were required to read ""American Cinematographer"" cover to cover every month, and countless other texts. All students were required to write / direct / edit a 16mm short film their sophomore year (added in late 1970s). All students were required to put in a set amount of hours working at the film studio, in various positions, to complement their classroom time. Those who passed these rigors, while maintaining passing grades in all their other university courses, were then eligible to assist in the production of the feature films Katherine Stenholm directed. In addition, she required that EACH senior level student write / produce / direct / edit a 16mm film for their senior thesis, in order to graduate-all the while continuing to assist in the studio's productions. In 1986, while filming in Russia for her then-upcoming film, ""The Printing,"" she suffered a minor stroke in Moscow. It was difficult to get through the red tape to get her a flight from Moscow to Helsinki because she and her team were with a tour group that was set to fly out from Leningrad to Helsinki. Once the task was accomplished and she returned home to the States, Tim Rogers was named as the director of Unusual Films and he directed ""The Printing"" in her place. During her illness, many students rallied to aid her in household chores and anything else needed. Though she retired from directing when her health recovered, she returned to teach the directing class until the 1999/2000 school year.","June 19, 1917 in Hendersonville, North Carolina, USA",1917-06-19,"Hendersonville, North Carolina, USA","November 3, 2015 in Greenville, South Carolina, USA",2015-11-03,"Greenville, South Carolina, USA",,Gilbert Stenholm  (1941 - 1989) (his death) (1 child),1,0,1,1

Then, at the age of 21, while doing an internship at the WDR TV Station in Köln (Cologne) Germany, he was literally discovered in the commissary -- Lana Turner style -- while joking with some young girls. A producer, struck by his good looks and infectious laughter, asked him if he was an actor. Not wanting to lose an opportunity, he said that he was and was given a screen test, resulting in his being cast for the new role of Ulli in the popular daily German late afternoon serial, ""Verbotene Liebe"" (Forbidden Love).While on that series, Andreas suddenly found himself a teen heartthrob for more than three years, in addition to breaking ground with his portrayal of a young gay teenager who ""comes out"" on the show. He also recorded a hit record, ""Just When I needed You Most,"" displaying his rich and throaty tenor voice. However, he soon found that his private life had vanished and he couldn't go anywhere -- not to the movies or a disco or even sit in a café without being besieged for autographs, pictures or conversation.Plus, his desire to direct continued to pull at him and he decided to leave the series. He applied to the prestigious Baden-Württemberg Film Akademie in southwest Germany and was accepted for admission among 800 candidates. At about the same time, he was asked to become a regular playing the role of Ben on the weekly series, ""Die Anrheiner."" He took the offer, as it kept his hand in the acting side of the business, provided an income while attending school and, as a weekly series, it was less demanding on his time.In 2006, he finished shooting his final thesis film, ""In Ewigkeit. Amen?,"" co-written with American TV/Film writer Michael Russnow. The project is a mystery comedy series, which opened doors for him at a lot of production companies and the leading German networks.At the outset of 2007, Andreas co-developed a new German TV series for Granada Entertainment. Then, in February 2007 he began his first professional directing gig on ""Staatsanwalt Posch ermittelt,"" a dramatized legal television series for the German company Filmpool televised on the RTL network.Granada then signed him in the fall of 2007 to direct alternate weekly blocks of the popular cooking competition series, ""Unter Volldampf!"" transmitted on the VOX Network in Germany.Also in the fall of 2007, Andreas asked to be released from ""Die Anrheiner"" after seven seasons on the show. His last episodes on the series will be televised in March 2008. In addition to his directing jobs, he is actively pursuing other acting opportunities in Germany, the U.S., the UK, Canada and Australia.","July 26, 1975 in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany",1975-07-26,"Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany",,,,,,0,0,0,0

She then went on to appear in various British movies, mainly of the comedy or horror genre, most famously the lead role in Mircalla, l'amante immortale (1971), as well as several television guest roles.She also got a six-month stint hosting a game show with British king of comedy, Bob Monkhouse. After struggling with myopic casting directors, who could not see the beauty and budding talent before them and were happier to just keep casting more established but less beautiful women, Yutte finally gave up and emigrated to the USA in the mid-seventies and took up a job selling air time for a Christian radio station in Oregan.Understandably reluctant to make appearances at horror conventions when British film publicists finally started to notice her when it was too late, she did relent and start appearing at a select few in the late 1990s, giving the non-fickle amongst her fans a chance to see her unique radiance once more.An inimitable beauty the likes of which has never been seen since, Yutte Stensgaard was possibly the biggest loss to movies since that of Sharon Tate.","May 14, 1946 in Thisted, Jutland, Denmark",1946-05-14,"Thisted, Jutland, Denmark",,,,,"Paul Walter  (25 June 2012 - present)

Stepanek fled to England in 1940, where, like many European refugee actors, he specialized in portraying Teutonic villains. He tried to stay away from out-and-out Nazi roles, but his predilection for wearing black uniforms and barking out guttural commands left little doubt as to the political preferences of Stepanek's screen characters. One of his most typical characterizations could be found in the 1946 POW drama, The Captive Heart; Stepanek also registered well as a friendlier foreigner in The Fallen Idol (1949). Commuting between London and Hollywood, Karel Stepanek continued to fight World War II, usually on the wrong side, into such '60s films as Sink the Bismarck! (1960), I Aim at the Stars (1960) and Operation Crossbow (1965).","October 29, 1899 in Brünn, Austria-Hungary [now Brno, Czech Republic]",1899-10-29,"Brünn, Austria-Hungary [now Brno, Czech Republic]","December 25, 1980 in London, England, UK  (undisclosed)",1980-12-25,"London, England, UK  ",undisclosed,,0,0,0,0

nm0826786,Angelina Stepanova,Angelina Iosifovna Stepanova,,"Angelina Stepanova was a notable actress of Moscow Art Theatre known as Anna Sherer in Voyna i mir (1966) by director Sergey Bondarchuk.She was born Angelina Iosifovna Stepanova on November 23, 1905, in Nikolaevsk-na Amure, Russian Empire (now Nikolaevsk-na Amure, Russia). Her father, Iosif Stepanov, was an insurance agent, her mother, Maria Vladimirovna, was a dentist. From 1921 - 1924 Angelina Stepanova studied acting under Evgeni Vakhtangov at 3rd Studio of Moscow Art Theatre, making her stage debut in the legendary Vakhtangov's staging of Carlo Gozzi's comedy 'Princess Turandot'. In 1924, Stepanova was invited to perform in A.K. Tolstoy's play 'Tsar Fedor Ioannovich' opposite Konstantin Stanislavski.From 1924 to 1994 Angelina Stepanova was a permanent member of the troupe at Moscow Art Theatre (MKhAT). There her stage partners included such renown Russian actors as Ivan Moskvin, Nikolay Khmelyov, Nikolai Sosnin, Alla Tarasova, Anatoli Ktorov, Olga Androvskaya, Angelina Stepanova, Anastasiya Georgievskaya, Mikhail Yanshin, Aleksey Gribov, Boris Livanov, Mikhail Kedrov, Viktor Stanitsyn, Vasili Toporkov, Mark Prudkin, Mikhail Bolduman, and the next generation of MKhAT actors - Oleg Efremov, Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy, Oleg Tabakov, Kira Golovko, Nina Gulyaeva, Tatyana Lavrova, Iya Savvina, Olga Barnet, Irina Miroshnichenko, Anastasiya Voznesenskaya, Andrey Myagkov, Vladimir Kashpur, Vladlen Davydov, Viktor Sergachyov, Vyacheslav Nevinnyy, Stanislav Lyubshin, Sergey Sazontev, Avangard Leontev, Igor Vasilev, and others.Stepanova was a member of the board at Moscow Art Theatre (MKhAT). Her most acclaimed stage performances at Moscow Art Theatre were as Irina in 'The Three Sisters' (1930) directed by Konstantin Stanislavski, and as Betsy in Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' (1937), for which Stepanova won critical acclaim on a tour in Paris. She was equally compelling playing epic leads and character roles. During the 50s, 60s and 70s, her most memorable appearances were in classic plays by Anton Chekhov, such as Arkadina in 'Chayka' (aka.. 'The Seagull), as Avdotya in 'Ivanov', as Irina in 'Tri sestry' (aka.. The Three Sisters), and as Ranevskaya in 'Vishnevy sad' (aka.. The Cherry Orchard), the role she inherited from Olga Knipper-Chekhova. During the 80s, Stepanova joined Oleg Efremov after the split of the Moscow Art Theatre in two companies. In 1998 she made her last public appearance at the Centennial Anniversary of the Moscow Art Theatre.During the Stalin's era, Stepanova was rarely cast in Soviet movies, according to ""Stalin's spell"" upon actors of the Moscow Art Theatre. She made her film debut in 1946 when the Soviet State allowed filming of the Moscow Art Theatre stage productions. At that time Stepanova, aged 40, appeared as young Anya, Ranevskaya's daughter opposite Olga Knipper-Chekhova. In 1953 she appeared opposite Alla Tarasova in Anna Karenina (1953), another record of a stage production by the cast of the Moscow Art Theater. Stepanova had to wait until the age of 60 to play her best known film role as Anna Sherer, a noblewoman in Voyna i mir (1966) by director Sergey Bondarchuk. She later co-starred opposite Boris Babochkin and Donatas Banionis in Begstvo mistera Mak-Kinli (1975), and also played bit parts in a few more Soviet films.Stepanova received the Stalin's Prize (1952), and was designated People's Actress of the USSR (1960).

nm0827031,Harvey Stephens,William Harvey Stephens,182,"At age 30, actor Harvey Stephens had a sophisticated charm and staid, long-jawed handsomeness that seemed ideal for the big screen, particularly in elegant or period settings. A veteran of a handful of Broadway shows by the time he made his sudden move to film, he was handed on a silver platter a debut starring role. The drawback was that playing opposite him would be a Broadway legend and one the boldest scenery chewers of all-time -- Tallulah Bankhead. The ""leading man"" opportunities went quickly downhill from there for Harvey but he redeemed himself quite well in the next few years as a poised second lead player and (later) dependable character actor on TV.Born on August 21, 1901, the Los Angeles native attended U.C.L.A. before training with Walter Hampden's repertory company for two years as well as in various other stock companies. He had already married Beatrice Nichols in 1929 by the time he established himself on Broadway. Taking his first Broadway bow with a role in ""Other Men's Wives"" (1929), he went on to appear in ""Dishonored Lady"" (1930) with the great Katharine Cornell and ""Tomorrow and Tomorrow"" (1931) with Herbert Marshall and Zita Johann by the time Hollywood came calling.Paramount's Pre-Code drama The Cheat (1931) was an auspicious first assignment For Harvey in which he was cast as decent, upper-scale guy Jeffrey Carlyle, the concerned husband to voracious party girl and gambler Elsa Carlyle, played to the hilt by Tallulah Bankhead. Bankhead, the larger-than-life celebrity deemed too big for the screen, took no prisoners and Harvey was dwarfed for most of the proceedings. Despite his obvious talent, Harvey's big chance for stardom was snuffed out. This would be his first and only chance at male star movie material.Continuing diligently on Broadway in such plays as ""The Animal Kingdom"" (1932) with Leslie Howard, ""Best Years"" (1932), ""Conquest"" (1932), ""I Loved You Wednesday"" (1932) and ""The Party's Over"" (1933), Fox signed Harvey up in 1933 and from there he appeared in second leads and/or ""other man"" parts, bolstering a number of quality films and providing a good-looking distraction between some of Hollywood's most popular cinematic stars. His first ruffled up the Janet Gaynor and Warner Baxter coupling in the comedy Adorabile (1933). From there he enjoyed playing cads, flirts, and various wealthy suitor types who tried to come between some of Hollywood's glossiest and most popular pairings: William Powell and 'Myrna Loy' in L'amante sconosciuta (1934); Spencer Tracy and Myrna Loy in Le 4 perle (1935); Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray in La vergine di Salem (1937); and Carole Lombard and Fred MacMurray in Swing High, Swing Low (1937).By the end of the decade, however, Harvey was receiving credit much further down the list, especially in the higher-quality films of a Beau Geste (1939), Abramo Lincoln (1940), Il sergente York (1941) and Le schiave della città (1944). By the end of WWII, his film career had subsided drastically. As such, he returned to Broadway in 1944 with both ""Over 21"" starring Ruth Gordon and ""Violet"". In 1949 he had an officious featured role in the musical classic ""South Pacific"" starring Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza in the non-singing role of Lt. Harbison, only one of two non-singing parts in the show. He stayed with the show for several years.TV occupied much of Harvey's time in the 1950s, now a well-oiled character actor, but he never found any one series that might have given his character name a noticeable boost. His last Broadway role came with ""Time Limit"" (1956). Following unbilled roles in I giovani leoni (1958), Intrigo internazionale (1959) and Compania di codardi? (1964), he ended his career on TV in 1965 with an episode of ""Bonanza,"" then retired quietly to the Southern California area. Harvey died just a few days before Christmas in 1986 at the Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, California, and was survived by present wife Barbara and three children. He was 85 years old.","August 21, 1901 in Los Angeles, California, USA",1901-08-21,"Los Angeles, California, USA","December 22, 1986 in Laguna Hills, California, USA  (undisclosed)",1986-12-22,"Laguna Hills, California, USA  ",undisclosed,"Barbara Adams  (1946 - 22 December 1986) (his death) (2 children)

nm0827261,Henry Stephenson,Henry Stephenson Garroway,188,"Stephenson was a firm, dignified, worldly presence in Hollywood's classic history-based films of the 30s and 40s. The tall British character actor Henry Stephenson could be both imposing and benevolent in his patrician portrayals, usually expounding words of wisdom or offering gentlemanly aid. He was born Henry S. Garroway in Granada, British West Indies on April 16, 1871 and studied at Rugby in England. His reputation was built solidly on the stage both in America and in England, making his Broadway debut around the turn of the century with ""A Message from Mars"" in 1901. While he did make a few silent pictures (from 1917), film audiences began taking a notice only in later years. After transferring a successful Broadway role to film with Infedele (1932), Stephenson settled in Hollywood where he distinguished himself in a variety of pictures for RKO, MGM and Warner Bros., among others. He appeared quite frequently in royal support for Warners' top star of the time, Errol Flynn, including Capitan Blood (1935) as Lord Willoughby, La carica dei seicento (1936) as Sir Charles Macefield, Il principe e il povero (1937) as the Duke of Norfolk, and Il conte di Essex (1939) as Lord Burghley. His last film was the sentimental yarn Il ritorno di Lassie (1949). Long married to character actress Ann Shoemaker, Stephenson died on April 24, 1956 in San Francisco, California at age 85, and was survived by his widow and daughter.","April 16, 1871 in Granada, British West Indies",1871-04-16,"Granada, British West Indies","April 24, 1956 in San Francisco, California, USA  (illness)",1956-04-24,"San Francisco, California, USA  ",illness,"Roxy Claudia May Barton  (14 June 1906 - ?) (divorced) (1 child)

A bank clerk to begin with, he later pursued a career as a merchant and served with the British Army during World War I. He had no formal acting training, but a growing interest led him to amateur theatre presentations and eventually working professionally on the London and Liverpool stages.Rather late in life, the 48-year-old Stephenson made his film debut with the British drama The Perfect Crime (1937) at Warner Brothers' Teddington Studios in England. He continued there with the comedy You Live and Learn (1937) and the mystery Mr. Satan (1938). Warner mogul Jack Warner saw much promise in Stephenson and summoned him to Hollywood where he became a studio contract player. Having married Lorna Hewitt Anderson (1908-1967) in 1936, Stephenson left his homeland and emigrated to America, summoning her later once he settled in. They eventually became U.S. citizens in 1938.During his extremely short stay, the distinguished gent with the clipped tones and neat, sliver mustache indulged himself in urbane villainy in the oily, cultivated tradition of George Sanders and his brother Tom Conway. He proved a reliable support in such films as You Live and Learn (1937), Boy Meets Girl (1938), Nancy Drew: Detective (1938), Bandiere bianche (1938), Confessions of a Nazi Spy (1939), La bolgia dei vivi (1939), Espionage Agent (1939) and the classic adventures Beau Geste (1939) and Lo sparviero del mare (1940).At one point he was entrusted by director William Wyler and mega-star Bette Davis to play the sympathetic role of the family attorney Howard Joyce in the melodrama Ombre malesi (1940). It was the role of a lifetime and he didn't let them down for he earned an Oscar nomination in the process. He had supported Ms. Davis earlier in her dramatic vehicles Il grande amore (1939) and Il conte di Essex (1939).Stephenson was soon on a roll. Having been handed the role of the titular sleuth in Calling Philo Vance (1940), he was finally first-billed in the above-average ""B"" movie Shining Victory (1941) when he when he tragically suffered a myocardial infarction in 1941, dying at age 52 in Pacific Palisades.

Sterling married actress Ann Sothern in 1943 after meeting her on the set of Ringside Maisie (1941), one of several programmers in Sothern's ""Maisie"" series. They had a daughter, Patricia, who later became the actress Tisha Sterling. While at MGM he appeared in slick, ""nice guy"" second leads in such ""A"" films as Greta Garbo's swan song Non tradirmi con me (1941), Sorvegliato speciale (1941) and Incontro a Bataan (1942), the last two starring Lana Turner, while starring in ""B"" rankers that included The Get-Away (1941) and This Time for Keeps (1942). Sterling himself would serve during WWII with the Army Air Force as a pilot instructor and was stationed at one point in London.His movie persona suggested more than a trace of the dapper playboy, and his carefree style and tone easily had Gig Young coming to mind. Robert's film career, however, lost major momentum in post-war years with rather pat, colorless parts in such action dramas as Bunco Squad (1950) and Il tenente dinamite (1953), and even in the splashy musical Show Boat (1951). Divorced from Ms. Sothern in 1949, he was introduced to actress Anne Jeffreys while making his Broadway debut in ""Gramercy Ghost"" down the block from where she was starring in the musical ""Kiss Me Kate."" The couple wed in 1951 and produced three sons. Robert and Anne (who was also having a down time in films by this point) decided to revive their faltering careers with a singing club act. Not only was their pairing a success, it led directly to their starring roles in the classic Topper (1953) comedy series on TV. As wry, debonair ghost George Kirby, he and Anne (playing his equally ""spirited"" wife Marion) expertly took over the jet-setting roles established on film by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett. The couple soon became household names engaging audiences week after week with their delightfully capricious antics and disappearing acts, much to the chagrin of bemused mortal Leo G. Carroll in the title role. Robert and Anne continued to perform together on stage (""Bells Are Ringing"") and even top-lined another sitcom Love That Jill (1958) which lasted only a few months. After another failed series Ichabod and Me (1961), which was a solo effort, and a couple of pedestrian parts in the movies Ritorno a Peyton Place (1961) (as Dr. Michael Rossi) (1961), Viaggio in fondo al mare (1961) and I guai di papà (1964), Robert slacked off considerably. He made only one return to Broadway with the 1961 light comedy ""Roman Candle"" co-starring Inger Stevens and Julia Meade. The show folded quickly. By the late 1960s, Sterling was pretty much out of the picture.He entered into what would become a lucrative computer business, and kept a decidedly low profile, prompting many fans to think that the ever-busy Anne Jeffreys was a widow! In truth, the couple made sporadic appearances together in the 70s and 80s in episodes of ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Hotel,"" among others. During the last decade of his life, Sterling suffered greatly from shingles, which kept him confined to a bed for the most part. The man who was once deemed ""the ghost with the most"" died in his Brentwood home of natural causes at the age of 88.","November 13, 1917 in New Castle, Pennsylvania, USA",1917-11-13,"New Castle, Pennsylvania, USA","May 30, 2006 in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, USA  (natural causes)",2006-05-30,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, USA  ",natural causes,"Anne Jeffreys  (21 November 1951 - 30 May 2006) (his death) (3 children)

Casey next moved to Toronto, where he found an agent and worked on the stage, on television commercials, and minor roles on CBC television. In 1977, his curiosity about other life styles took him to Rishikesh, a small town in India. There he lived in a monastery, and practiced yoga and studied meditation. All his personal needs were taken care of by the Hindu monks, who provided for Stevens and his introduction to yoga. After 6 months, tiring of the quiet lifestyle, he became anxious to get back to acting. He moved directly to Hollywood. After 5 months, and no luck, he called one of the top agencies in Hollywood and told them about a hot new talent in Hollywood. ""You've got to see Casey Stevens"". They agreed to see him, and the next day he had an agent with one of the top firms. He was first cast in the film ""No Place To Hide.""

nm0828328,Connie Stevens,Concetta Rosalie Anna Ingolia,157,"Lovely, indefatigable Connie Stevens added sparkle to a number of films and TV shows in the late 50s and 60s Hollywood. Brooklyn born Concetta Rosalie Ann Ingoglia is of Italian/Sicilian and Irish descent, the daughter of Eleanor McGinley and Teddy Stevens (born Pietro Ingoglia). She was subsequently raised by her grandparents when her mother and father (a band singer and jazz musician, respectively) filed for divorce. Connie attended Catholic boarding schools in her formative years. Inheriting her parents' love and talent for music, she formed a vocal quartet called ""The Foremost"" which was comprised of Connie and three men. Those men later became part of The Lettermen.In Hollywood from 1953, Connie formed yet another vocal group ""The Three Debs"" while trying to break into films doing extra work. Moving up to the co-star ranks in a few mediocre teen dramas such as Young and Dangerous (1957), Eighteen and Anxious (1957), The Party Crashers (1958), and Dragstrip Riot (1958), it was comedian Jerry Lewis who set things in motion by casting her in his comedy Il balio asciutto (1958). As such, Warner Bros. signed her up for their hot detective series Hawaiian Eye (1959) and she was off. As pert and pretty ""Cricket Blake"", a slightly flaky and tomboyish singer/photographer, Connie became an instant teen idol -- trendy and undeniably appealing. A couple of record offers (and hits) came her way as a result including ""Sixteen Reasons"" and the novelty song ""Kookie, Kookie, Lend Me Your Comb"" (in tribute to Edd Byrnes' hip, teen idol character on the popular detective series Indirizzo permanente (1958)).Adored for her sexy effervescence, Connie tried to broaden her ""sex kitten"" image in the 60's with serious attempts at adult film drama, including the title role in Qualcosa che scotta (1961), as well as co-leads in Vento caldo (1961), Giorni caldi a Palm Springs (1963), and Il boia è di scena (1965), but they were modestly received. For the most part, she remained a comfy TV presence in musical variety shows (""The Red Skelton Show,"" ""Kraft Music Hall""), westerns (""Cheyenne,"" ""Maverick"") and game shows (""Hollywood Squares""). She also appeared opposite George Burns in a second series, the sitcom Wendy and Me (1964), and co-starred in a couple of lightweight films, Never Too Late (1965) and Stazione luna (1966), again with Jerry Lewis.In the 1970s, she refocused on her voice and started lining up singing commercials (Ace Hardware) while subsisting in nightclubs and hotels. Connie eventually built herself up as a Las Vegas headlining act. She also starred on Broadway with ""The Star-Spangled Girl"" and won a Theatre World Award for her performance in 1967.

nm0828359,Dennis F. Stevens,Dennis F. Stevens,,"Dennis F. Stevens is best known as the producer of the hit feature ""The Harrad Experiment"" (1973), starring relatively unknown Don Johnson. But he also produced two other feature films: ""Harrad Summer"" (1974), and ""I Wonder Who's Killing Her Now?"" (1975); together with writing and directing over 75 television commercials, including some for the Accor Group and the best known wineries of France and California.Working with companies such as Cinema Arts Productions, Inc., Air Log, and RFG Associates, Inc., Stevens was involved in the writing, directing and/or photographing of specialty projects for the Department of Defense (DoD), Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, Gould Electronics, and Phillips Electronics, among many others. These specialty films, sometimes referred to as business, industrial or, ""fill"" films, with the exception of the latter, were produced mainly for exhibition at trade shows and corporate meetings.""Fill"" films were those distributed free to schools and television stations. In the case of schools, the Insurance Institute of America or the Plastics Institute of America, both non profit educational and research institutes, distributed films directed by Dennis F. Stevens. One of these films, entitled, ""Plastics: The World of Imagination,"" won a prestigious Chris Award for Stevens as director. These sponsored films provided details, or ""filled in"" the teachers' lesson plan for the day.Other ""fill"" films, sponsored by the DoD, were distributed free to television stations for the possibility of increasing military recruitment. In the 1960s, television stations played these half-hour films whenever they found themselves short of something else to screen, thus the term ""fill."" Today, the military itself in-house produces most of these films, thus contributing to the demise of companies such as Air Log, which specialized in military aerial photography and filming aboard aircraft carriers.With the success of ""The Harrad Experiment,"" Stevens could likely have continued producing feature films but instead chose to team with mentors Robert Lawrence Balzer and Duke Goldstone to do commercials, together with the above described specialty films. Robert Lawrence Balzer was the wine critic for the Los Angeles Times and the person responsible for choosing and bestowing the Holiday Magazine awards. Louis ""Duke"" Goldstone's RFG Associates, Inc. was the production and editorial arm of the Swift-Chaplin Agency, which agency was responsible for creating the Jolly Green Giant, Hamm's Bear (animated) and Speedy Alka Selzer commercials.Thanks in large part to Balzer, Stevens made television commercials for 43 wineries in California and France. Working with RFG Associates, Inc. Stevens wrote, directed and/or photographed some 32 additional television commercials and business films.From August 1979 thru April 1980, Stevens covered the final days of the Zimbabwe War of Independence for Reuters. The news service bureau also hired Stevens to cover the Gulf War from Israel, in 1991.In 1980, Dennis F. Stevens directed 26 half-hour episodes of ""AD LIB,"" a jazz show for the Black Entertainment Network, hosted by Phil Moore and featuring jazz legends (in order of production date): Ella Fitzgerald, Freddie Hubbard, Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis, Jr., Jon Hendricks, Freda Payne, Jimmy Witherspoon, Dianne Reeves, Linda Hopkins, Charles Brown, O. C. Smith, Billy Daniels, Kenny Rankin, Willy Bobo, ""Scat-man"" Crothers, Sergio Mendes, and many more.That same year Stevens produced 52 half-hour episodes of the ""ROCKY ROAD"" show, distributed to MTV, featuring: Missing Persons, The Bus Boys, Romeo Void, Tower of Power, James Harman, Meatloaf, Crystal Gale, Huey Lewis & the News, Marshal Tucker, and many more.In the early 1980s, Stevens directed 20 musical videos for Capital/EMI, and other record labels. Among others produced and co-directed (with Chris Donovan) the Missing Persons, ""I Like Boys"" video, winner of the 1982 ACE award.Mervin Leroy and Mike Frankovich sponsored Stevens' membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in 1974. He became a member of the Writers Guild of America when hired by Dick Powell and Four Star Productions to think up plots for its then vast television programming.

nm0828419,George Stevens,George Cooper Stevens,180,"George Stevens, a filmmaker known as a meticulous craftsman with a brilliant eye for composition and a sensitive touch with actors, is one of the great American filmmakers, ranking with John Ford, William Wyler and Howard Hawks as a creator of classic Hollywood cinema, bringing to the screen mytho-poetic worlds that were also mass entertainment. One of the most honored and respected directors in Hollywood history, Stevens enjoyed a great degree of independence from studios, producing most of his own films after coming into his own as a director in the late 1930s. Though his work ranged across all genres, including comedies, musicals and dramas, whatever he did carried the hallmark of his personal vision, which is predicated upon humanism.Although the cinema is an industrial process that makes attributions of ""authorship"" difficult if not downright ridiculous (despite the contractual guarantees in Directors Guild of America-negotiated contracts), there is no doubt that George Stevens is in control of a George Stevens picture. Though he was unjustly derided by critics of the 1960s for not being an ""auteur,"" an auteur he truly is, for a Stevens picture features meticulous attention to detail, the thorough exploitation of a scene's visual possibilities and ingenious and innovative editing that creates many layers of meanings. A Stevens picture contains compelling performances from actors whose interactions have a depth and intimacy rare in motion pictures. A Stevens picture typically is fully engaged with American society and is a chronicled photoplay of the pursuit of The American Dream.George Stevens was nominated five times for an Academy Award as Best Director, winning twice, and six of the movies he produced and directed were nominated for Best Picture Oscars. In 1953 he was the recipient of the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award for maintaining a consistent level of high-quality production. He served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences from 1958 to 1959. Stevens won the Directors Guild of America Best Director Award three times as well as the D.W. Griffith Lifetime Achievement Award. He made five indisputable classics: Follie d'inverno (1936), a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical; Gunga Din (1939), a rousing adventure film; La donna del giorno (1942), a battle-of-the-sexes comedy; Un posto al sole (1951), a drama that broke new ground in the use of close-ups and editing; and Il cavaliere della valle solitaria (1953), a distillation of every Western cliché that managed to both sum up and transcend the genre. His Ho sognato un angelo (1941), Un evaso ha bussato alla porta (1942), Molta brigata vita beata (1943), Mamma ti ricordo! (1948) and Il gigante (1956) all live on in the front rank of motion pictures.George Cooper Stevens was born on December 18, 1904, in Oakland, California, to actor Landers Stevens and his wife, actress Georgie Cooper, who ran their own theatrical company in Oakland, Ye Liberty Playhouse. Cooper herself was the daughter of an actress, Georgia Woodthorpe (both ladies' Christian names offstage were Georgia, though their stage names were Georgie). Georgie Cooper appeared as Little Lord Fauntleroy as a child along with her mother at Los Angeles' Burbank Theater. George's parents' company performed in the San Francisco Bay area, and as individual performers they also toured the West Coast as vaudevillians on the Opheum circuit. Their theatrical repertoire included the classics, giving the young George the chance to forge an understanding of dramatic structure and what works with an audience. In 1922 Stevens' parents abandoned live theater and moved their family, which consisted of George and his older brother John Landers Stevens (later to be known as Jack Stevens), south to Glendale, California, to find work in the movie industry.Both of Stevens' parents gained steady employment as movie actors. Landers appeared in Piccolo Cesare (1931), Nemico pubblico (1931) and Quarto potere (1941) in small parts. His brother was Chicago Herald-American drama critic Ashton Stevens (1872-1951), who was hired by William Randolph Hearst for his San Francisco Examiner after Ashton had taught him how to play the banjo. An interviewer of movie stars and a notable man-about-town, Ashton mentored the young Orson Welles, who based the Jedediah Leland character in Quarto potere (1941) on him. Georgie Cooper's sister Olive Cooper became a screenwriter after a short stint as an actress. Jack became a movie cameraman, as did their second son.Stevens' movie adaptation of ""I Remember Mama,"" the chronicle of a Norwegian immigrant family trying to assimilate in San Francisco circa 1910, could be a mirror on the Stevens family's own move to Los Angeles circa 1922. In ""Mama"", the members of the Hanson family feel like outsiders, a theme that resonates throughout Stevens' work. Acting was considered an insalubrious profession before the rise of Ronald Reagan's generation of actors into the halls of power, and being a member of an acting family necessarily marked one as an outsider in the first half of the 20th century. Young George had to drop out of high school to drive his father to his acting auditions, which would have further enhanced his sense of being an outsider. To compensate for his lack of formal education, Stevens closely studied theater, literature and the emerging medium of the motion picture.Soon after arriving in Hollywood, the 17-year-old Stevens got a job at the Hal Roach Studios as an assistant cameraman; it was a matter of being in the right place at the right time. Of that period, when the cinema was young, Stevens reminisced, ""There were no unions, so it was possible to become an assistant cameraman if you happened to find out just when they were starting a picture. There was no organization; if a cameraman didn't have an assistant, he didn't know where to find one.""As part of Hal Roach's company, Stevens learned the art of visual storytelling while the form was still being developed. Part of his visual education entailed the shooting of low-budget westerns, some of which featured Rex. Within two years Stevens became a director of photography and a writer of gags for Roach on the comedies of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.His first credited work as a cameraman at the Roach Studios was for the Stan Laurel short Roughest Africa (1923). Stevens was a terrific cameraman, most notably in Laurel & Hardy's comedies (both silent and talkies), and it was as a cameraman that his aesthetic began to develop. The cinema of George Stevens was rooted in humanism, and he focused on telling details and behavior that elucidated character and relationships. This aesthetic started developing on the Laurel & Hardy comedies, where he learned about the interplay of relationships between ""the one who is looked at"" and ""the one doing the looking."" Verisimilitude, always a hallmark of a Stevens picture, also was part of the Laurel and Hardy curricula; Oliver Hardy once said, ""We did a lot of crazy things in our pictures, but we were always real.""From a lighting cameraman, Stevens advanced to a director of short subjects for Roach at Universal. Within a year of moving to RKO in 1933, he began directing comedy features. His break came in 1935 at RKO, when house diva Katharine Hepburn chose Stevens as the director of Primo amore (1935). Based on a Booth Tarkington novel about a young woman from the lower-middle class who dares to dream big, the movie injected the theme of class aspiration and the frustrations of the pursuit of happiness while dreaming the American dream into Stevens' oeuvre. Before there was cinema of ""outsiders"" recognized in the late 1970s, there were Stevens' outsiders, fighting against their atomization and alienation through their not-always-successful interactions with other people.Stevens created his first classic in 1936, when RKO assigned him to helm the sixth Astaire-Rogers musical, Follie d'inverno (1936). Stevens' past as a lighting cameraman prepared him for the innovative visuals of this musical comedy. Through his control of the camera's field of vision, Stevens as a director creates an atmosphere that engenders emotional effects in his audience. In one scene Astaire opens a mirrored door that the scene's reflection in actuality is being shot on, and being keyed into the illusion emotionally introduces the audience into the picture, in sly counterpoint to Buster Keaton's walk into the screen in his _Sherlock, Jr. (1924)_ . Stevens' use of light in ""Swing Time"" is audacious. He freely introduces light into scenes, with the effect that it enlivens them and gives them a ""light"" touch, such as the final scene where ""sunlight"" breaks out over the painted backdrop. The film never drags and is a brilliant showcase for the dancing team. Rogers claimed it was her favorite of all her pictures with Astaire.Stevens' next classic was the rip-roaring adventure yarn Gunga Din (1939), based on the Rudyard Kipling poem. Though no longer politically correct in the 21st century, the picture still works in terms of action and star power, as three British sergeants--Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.--try to put down a rampage by a notorious death cult in 19th-century colonial India.Having learned his craft in the improvisational milieu of silent pictures, Stevens would often wing it, shooting from an underdeveloped screenplay that was ever in flux, finding the film as he shot it and later edited it. With filmmaking becoming more and more expensive in the 1930s due to the studios' penchant for making movies on a vaster scale than they had previously, Stevens' methods led to anxiety for the bean-counters in RKO's headquarters. His improvisatory crafting of ""Gunga Din"" resulted in the film's shooting schedule almost doubling from 64 to 124 days, with its cost reaching a then-incredible $2 million (few sound films had grossed more than $5 million up to that point, and a picture needed to gross from two to 2-1/2 times its negative cost to break even).Studio executives were driven to distraction by Stevens' methods, such as his taking nearly a year to edit the footage he shot for ""Shane."" His films typically were successful, though, and in the late 1930s he became his own producer, earning him greater latitude than that enjoyed by virtually any other filmmaker with the obvious exceptions of Cecil B. DeMille and Frank Capra. He made three significant comedies in the early 1940s: La donna del giorno (1942), the darker-in-tone Un evaso ha bussato alla porta (1942) (a film that touches on the subject of civil rights and the miscarriage of justice) and Molta brigata vita beata (1943) before going off to war.Joining the Army Signal Corps, Stevens headed up a combat motion picture unit from 1944 to 1946. In addition to filming the Normandy landings, his unit shot both the liberation of Paris and the liberation of the Nazi extermination camp Dachau, and his unit's footage was used both as evidence in the Nuremberg trials and in the de-Nazification program after the war. Stevens was awarded the Legion of Merit for his services. Many critics claim that the somber, deeply personal tone of the movies he made when he returned from World War II were the result of the horrors he saw during the war. Stevens' first wife, Yvonne, recalled that he ""was a very sensitive man. He just never dreamed, I'm sure, what he was getting into when he enlisted."" Stevens wrote a letter to Yvonne in 1945, telling her that ""if it hadn't been for your letters . . . there would have been nothing to think cheerfully about, because you know that I find much [of] this difficult to believe in fundamentally.""The images of war and Dachau continued to haunt Stevens, but it also engendered in him the belief that motion pictures had to be socially meaningful to be of value. Along with fellow Signal Corps veterans Frank Capra and William Wyler, Stevens founded Liberty Films to produce his vision of the human condition. The major carryover from his prewar oeuvre to his postwar films is the affection the director has for his central characters, emblematic of his humanism.Stevens' second postwar film, Un posto al sole (1951), was his adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy,"" updated to contemporary America. Released three years after his family film Mamma ti ricordo! (1948), it features an outsider, George Eastman, trapped in the net of the American Dream, the pursuit of which dooms him. Sergei M. Eisenstein had written an adaptation for Paramount of ""An American Tragedy"" (the title a sly reversal of ""The American Dream""), but Eisenstein's participation in the project was jettisoned when the studio came under attack by right-wing politicians and organizations for hiring a ""Communist"", and the U.S. government deported Eisenstein shortly afterward. His script was unceremoniously dumped, and Josef von Sternberg eventually made the picture, but his vision was so far from Dreiser's that the old literary lion sued the studio. The film was recut and proved to be both a critical and box-office failure.Alfred Hitchcock maintained that it was far easier to make a good picture from a mediocre or bad drama or book than it was from a good work or a masterpiece. It remained for George Stevens to turn a literary masterpiece into a cinematic one--a unique trick in Hollywood. What was revolutionary about ""A Place in the Sun,"" in terms of technique, is Stevens' use of close-ups. Charlton Heston has pointed out that no one had ever used close-ups the way Stevens had in the picture. He used them more frequently than was the norm circa 1950, and he used extreme close-ups that, when combined with his innovative, slow-dissolve editing, created its own atmosphere, its own world that brought the audience into George Eastman's world, even into his embrace with the girl of his dreams, and also into the rowboat on that fateful day that would forever change his life. The editing technique of slow-lapping dissolves slowed down time and elongated the tempo of a scene in a way never before seen on screen.Stevens' mastery over the art of the motion picture was recognized with his first Academy Award for direction, beating out Elia Kazan for that director's own masterpiece, Un tram che si chiama Desiderio (1951) and Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly for THEIR masterpiece, Un americano a Parigi (1951), for the Best Picture Oscar winner that year (most observers had expected ""Sun"" or ""Streetcar"" to win, but they had split the vote and allowed ""American"" to nose them out at the finish line. MGM's publicity department acknowledged as much when it ran a post-Oscar ad featuring Leo the Lion with copy that began, ""I was standing in the Sun waiting for a Streetcar when . . . "").Stevens' theme of the outsider continued with his next classic, Il cavaliere della valle solitaria (1953). The eponymous gunman is an outsider, but so is the Starrett family he has decided to defend, as are the ""sodbusters"", and even the range baron who is now outside his time, outside his community and outside human decency. Il gigante (1956), Stevens' sprawling three-hour epic based on Edna Ferber's novel about Texas, also features outsiders: sister Luz Benedict, hired-hand transformed into millionaire oilman Jett Rink, transplanted Tidewater belle Leslie Benedict, her two rebellious children and eventually her husband Bick Benedict, a near-stereotypical Texan who finally steps outside of his parochialism and is transformed into an outsider when he decides to fight, physically, against discrimination against Latinos as a point of honor. The Otto Frank family and their compatriots in hiding in Il diario di Anna Frank (1959), American cinema's first movie to deal with the Holocaust, are outsiders, while Christ in his La più grande storia mai raccontata (1965)--subtle, complex and unknowable--is the ultimate outsider. L'unico gioco in città (1970)--Stevens' last film with Elizabeth Taylor, his female lead in ""A Place in the Sun"" and ""Giant""--was about two outsiders, an aging chorus girl and a petty gambler.Stevens' reputation suffered after the 1950s, and he didn't make another film until halfway into the 1960s. The film he did produce after that long hiatus was misunderstood and underappreciated when it was released. La più grande storia mai raccontata (1965), a picture about the ministry and passion of Christ, was one of the last epic films. It was maligned by critics and failed at the box office. It was on this picture that Stevens' improvisatory method began to take a toll on him. It took six years from the release of ""Anne Frank,"" which had garnered Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director, until the release of ""Greatest Story."" There had been a long gestation period for the film, and it was renowned as a difficult shoot, so much so that David Lean helped out a man he considered a master by shooting some ancillary scenes for the picture. The film has a look of vastness that many critics misunderstood as emptiness rather than as a visual correlative of the soul. Stevens' script is inspired by the three Synoptic Gospels, particular the Gospel According to St. John. John stresses the interior relation between the self and things beyond its knowledge. Though misunderstood by critics at the time of its release, the film has become more appreciated some 40 years later. Stevens is a master of the cinema, and is fully in command of the dissolves and emotive use of sound he used so effectively in ""A Place in the Sun.""His last film, L'unico gioco in città (1970), also was not a critical or box-office success, as Elizabeth Taylor's star had gone into steep decline as the 1970s dawned. Frank Sinatra had originally been slated to be her co-star, but Ol' Blue Eyes, notorious for preferring one-take directors, likely had second thoughts about being in a film directed by Stevens, who had a (well-deserved) reputation for multiple takes. His filmmaking method entailed shooting take after take of a scene during principal photography from every conceivable angle and from multiple focal points, so he'd have a plethora of choices in the editing room, which is where he made his films (unlike John Ford, famous for his lack of coverage, who had a reputation of ""editing"" in the camera, shooting only what he thought necessary for a film). Warren Beatty, typically underwhelming in films in which he wasn't in control, proved a poor substitute for Sinatra, and the film tanked big-time when it was released, further tarnishing Stevens' reputation.In a money-dominated culture in which the ethos ""What Have You Done For Me Lately?"" is prominent, George Stevens was relegated to has-been status, and the fact that he had established himself as one of the greats of American cinema was ignored, then forgotten altogether in popular culture. Donald Richie's 1984 biography ""George Stevens: An American Romantic"" tags Stevens with the ""R"" word, but it is too simplistic a generalization for such a complicated artist. Stevens' films demand that the audience remain in the moment and absorb all the details on offer in order to fully understand the morality play he is telling. James Agee had been a great admirer of Stevens the director, but Agee died in the 1950s and the 1960s was a new age, an iconoclastic age, and George Stevens and the classical Hollywood cinema he was a master of were considered icons to be smashed. Film critic Andrew Sarris, who introduced the ""auteur"" theory to America, disrespected Stevens in his 1968 book ""The American Cinema."" Stevens was not an auteur, Sarris wrote, and his latter films were big and empty. He became the symbol of what the new, auteurist cinema was against.The Cahiers du Cinema critics attacked Stevens by elevating Douglas Sirk. Sirk's Magnifica ossessione (1954), so the argument went, was a much better and more cogent exegesis of America than ""Giant,"" which was ""big and empty"" as was the country they attacked (though they loved its films). The point of iconoclasm is to smash idols, no matter what the reason--and Stevens, the master craftsman, was an idol. However, to say ""Giant"" was empty is absurd. To imply that George Stevens did not understand America is equally absurd. ""Giant"" contains what is arguably the premier moment in America cinema of the immediate postwar years, and it is an ""American"" moment--the confrontation between patrician rancher Bick Benedict and diner owner Sarge (Robert J. Wilke). Many critics and cinema historians have commented on the scene, favorably, but many miss the full import of it.The film has been built up to this climax. Benedict has shared the prejudices of his class and his race. All his life he has exploited the Mexicans whom he has lived with in a symbiotic relationship on HIS ranch, giving little thought to the injustice his class of overlords has wrought on Latinos, on poor whites, or on his own family. His wife, an Easterner, is appalled by the poverty and state of peonage of the Mexicans who work on the ranch and tries to do something about it. Her idealism is echoed in her son, who becomes a doctor, rejects his father's rancher heritage, and marries a Mexican-American woman, giving his father an Anglo/Mexican-American grandson.While out on a ride with his wife, daughter, daughter-in-law and her child, they stop at a roadside diner. Sarge, the proprietor, initially balks at serving them because of the Latinos in their party. He backs down, but when more Latinos come into his diner, he moves to throw them out. Benedict decides to intervene in a display of noblesse oblige, and also out of family duty. Sarge is unimpressed by Benedict's pedigree, and a fight breaks out between the hardened veteran--recently returned from the war, we are meant to understand--and the now aged Benedict. Bick first holds his own and Sarge crashes into the jukebox, setting off the song ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" while he recovers and then sets out to systematically demolish Mr. Bick Benedict, the overlord. As the song plays on in ironic counterpoint, shots of his distraught daughter and other family members are undercut with the cinematic crucifixion of Bick Benedict, the overlord, by the former Centurion. After Sarge has finished thrashing Benedict, he takes a sign off of the wall and throws it on Benedict's prostrate body: ""The management reserves the right to refuse service to anyone"". This is not only America of the 1950s, but America of the 21st century. For just as Sarge is defending racism, he is also defending his once-constitutional right to free association, as well as exerting his belief in Jeffersonian-Jacksonian democracy in thrashing a plutocrat. This is a type of yahooism that Bruce Catton, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the Civil War, attributed to the rebellion. There had always been a very well developed strain of reckless, individualistic violence in America, frequently encouraged, ritualized and sanctified by the state. The diner scene in ""Giant"" could only have been created by a man with a thorough knowledge of what America and Americans were (and continue to be). Sarge will try to accommodate Benedict, who has stepped out of his role as racist plutocrat into that of paternalistic pater familias, just as the sons of the robber barons of the 19th century--who justified their economic depravities with the doctrine of social Darwinism--did in the 20th century, endowing foundations that tried to right many wrongs, including racism, but Sarge will only go so far. When he is stretched beyond his limit, when his giving in is then ""pushed too far,"" he reacts, and reacts violently.This scene sums up American democracy and the human condition in America perhaps better than any other. America is a violent society, a gladiator society, in which progress is measured in, if not gained by, violence. Yes, Sarge is standing up for racism and segregation (a huge topic after the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling outlawing segregation), but he is also standing up for himself, and his beliefs, something he has recently fought for in World War II. The ironies are rich, just as the irony of American democracy, which excluded African-Americans and women and the native American tribes from the very first days of the U.S. Constitution, is rich. This is America, the scene in Sarge's diner says, and it is a critique only an American with a thorough knowledge of and sympathy for America could create. It is much more effective and philosophically true than the petty neo-Nazi caricatures of Lars von Trier's Dogville (2003), who are cowards. Characters in a George Stevens film may be reluctant, they may be hesitant, they may be conflicted, but they aren't cowardly.Another ironic scene in ""Giant"" features Mexican children singing the National Anthem during the funeral of Angel, who in counterpoint to Bick's son, his contemporary in age, is of the land, to the manor born, so to speak, but lacking those rights because of the color of his skin. Angel had gone off to war, and he returns to the Texas in which he was born on a caisson, in a coffin, starkly silhouetted against the Texas sky as the Benedict mansion had been earlier in the film when Leslie had first come to this benighted land. Angel, who had experienced racial bigotry due to his birth into poverty on the Benedict ranch, had fought Adolf Hitler. He is the only hero in ""Giant,"" and his death would be empty and meaningless without Bick Benedict's reluctant conversion to integration through fisticuffs.The great turning points in American cinema typically have involved race. The biggest, most significant movies of the first 50 years of the American cinema death with race: Uncle Tom's Cabin (1903), Edwin S. Porter's major movie before his The Great Train Robbery (1903) and the first film to feature inter-titles; Nascita di una nazione (1915), D.W. Griffith's racist masterpiece--which was a filming of a notorious pro-Ku Klux Klan book called ""The Clansman""--in which a non-sectarian America is formed in the linking of Southern and Northern whites to fight the African-American freedman; Il cantante di jazz (1927), in which a Jewish cantor's son achieves assimilation by donning blackface and disenfranchising black folk by purloining their music, which he deracinates, while turning his back on his Jewish identity by marrying a Gentile; and Via col vento (1939), the greatest Hollywood movie of all time--in which the Klan is never shown and the ""N"" word is never used, although the entire movie takes place in the immediate post-Civil War South--a sweeping, romantic masterpiece in which a reactionary, ultra-racist plutocracy is made out to be the flower of American chivalry and romance.Stevens' ""Giant"" was a major film of its time, and remains a motion picture of the first rank, but it was not the cultural blockbuster these movies were. Yet it more than any other Hollywood film of its time, aside from Elia Kazan's rather whitebread Barriera invisibile (1947) and Pinky la negra bianca (1949), directly addresses the great American dilemma, race, and its implications, and not from the familiar racist, white supremacist point of view that had been part of American movies since the very beginning. Those attitudes had been rooted in the American psyche even before the days of The Perils of Pauline (1914) serials (simultaneously serialized in the white supremacist Hearst newspapers), in which many a sweet young thing was threatened with death or--even worse, the loss of her maidenhead--by a sinister person of color (always played by a Caucasian in yellow or brown face).A 1934 ""Fortune Magazine"" story about the rosy financial prospects of the Technicolor Corp.'s new three-strip process contained a startling metaphor for a 21st-century reader: ""Then - like the cowboy bursting into the cabin just as the heroine has thrown the last flowerpot at the Mexican - came the three-color process to the rescue."" It was this endemic, accepted racism that Stevens challenged in ""Giant,"" which is at the root of America's expansionist philosophy of manifest destiny, and which was at the root of much of the southern and western economies. Those who died in World War II had to have died for something, not just the continuation of the status quo. It was a direct and knowing challenge to the system by someone who thoroughly knew and thoroughly cared about America and Americans.George Stevens died of a heart attack on March 8, 1975, in Lancaster, California. He would have been 100 years old in 2004, and in that year he was celebrated with screenings by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, London's British Film Institute, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His legacy lives on in the directorial work of fellow two-time Oscar-winning Best Director Clint Eastwood, particularly in Il cavaliere pallido (1985), which suffers from being too-close a ""Shane"" clone, and most memorably in his masterpiece, Gli spietati (1992).","December 18, 1904 in Oakland, California, USA",1904-12-18,"Oakland, California, USA","March 8, 1975 in Lancaster, California, USA  (heart attack)",1975-03-08,"Lancaster, California, USA  ",heart attack,"Joan Pauline O'Brien McTavish  (17 May 1968 - 8 March 1975) (his death)

nm0828447,Inger Stevens,Inger Stensland,166,"This enigmatic Stockholm-born beauty had everything going for her, including a rapidly rising film and TV career. Yet on April 30, 1970, at only 35, Inger Stevens would become another tragic Hollywood statistic -- added proof that fame and fortune do not always lead to happiness. Over time, a curious fascination, and perhaps even a morbid interest, has developed over Ms. Stevens and her life. What exactly went wrong? A remote, paradoxical young lady with obvious personal problems, she disguised it all with a seemingly positive attitude, an incredibly healthy figure and a megawatt smile that wouldn't quit. Although very little information has been filtered out about Ms. Stevens and her secretive life over the years, William T. Patterson's eagerly-anticipated biography, ""The Farmer's Daughter Remembered: The Biography of Actress Inger Stevens"" (2000), finally put an end to much of the mystery. But not quite all. The book claims that a large amount of previously-published information about Ms. Stevens is either untrue or distorted.A strong talent and consummate dramatic player of the late 50s and 60s, she was born Inger Stensland, the eldest of three children, of Swedish parentage. A painfully shy and sensitive child, she was initially drawn to acting as a girl after witnessing her father perform in amateur theater productions. Her rather bleak childhood could be directed at a mother who abandoned her family for another man when Inger was only 6. Her father moved to the States, remarried, and eventually summoned for Inger and a younger brother in 1944 to join him and his new bride. Family relations did not improve. As a teenager, she ran away from home and ended up in a burlesque chorus line only to be brought home by her father. After graduation and following some menial jobs here and there, she moved to New York and worked briefly as a model while studying at the Actors Studio. She broke into the business through TV commercials and summer stock, rising in the ingénue ranks as a guest in a number of weekly series.Often viewed as the beautiful loner or lady of mystery, an innate sadness seemed to permeate many of her roles. Inger made her film debut at age 22 opposite Bing Crosby in Tormento di un'anima (1957). Serious problems set in when Inger began falling in love with her co-stars. Broken affairs with Crosby, James Mason, her co-star in Lama Alla Gola (1958), Anthony Quinn, her director in Cecil B. DeMille's I bucanieri (1958), and Harry Belafonte, her co-star in La fine del mondo (1959), left her frequently depressed and ultimately despondent. An almost-fatal New Year's day suicide attempt in 1959 led to an intense period of self-examination and a new resolve. A brief Broadway lead in ""Roman Candle"", an Emmy-nominated role opposite Peter Falk in The Dick Powell Show: Price of Tomatoes (1962), and popular appearances on such TV shows as Bonanza (1959), Ai confini della realtà (1959) and Route 66 (1960) paved the way to a popular series as ""Katy Holstrum"", the Swedish governess, in The Farmer's Daughter (1963). This brisk, change-of-pace comedy role earned her a Golden Globe award and Emmy nomination, and lasted three seasons.Now officially a household name, Inger built up her momentum once again in films. A string of parts came her way within a three-year period including the sex comedy Una guida per l'uomo sposato (1967) as roving eye husband Walter Matthau's unsuspecting wife; Clint Eastwood's first home-made American ""spaghetti western"", Impiccalo più in alto (1968); the crime drama, Squadra omicidi, sparate a vista! (1968) with Henry Fonda and Richard Widmark; the westerns L'ora della furia (1968) with Fonda again plus James Stewart, and Poker di sangue (1968) opposite Dean Martin and Robert Mitchum; the political thriller Il castello di carte (1968) starring George Peppard and Orson Welles; and La stirpe degli dei (1969) which reunited her with old flame Anthony Quinn. Although many of her co-starring roles seemed to be little more than love interest filler, Inger made a noticeable impression in the last movie mentioned, by far the most intense and complex of her film career. Adding to that mixture were a number of well-made TV mini-movies. On the minus side, she also resurrected the bad habit of pursuing affairs with her co-stars, which would include Dean Martin and, most notably, Burt Reynolds, her last.In April of 1970, Inger signed on as a series lead in a crime whodunit The Most Deadly Game (1970) to be telecast that September. It never came to be. Less than a week later, she was found unconscious on the floor of her kitchen by her housekeeper and died en route to the hospital of acute barbiturate intoxication -- a lethal combination of drugs and alcohol. Yvette Mimieux replaced her in the short-lived series that fall. For all intents and purposes, Ms. Stevens' death was a suicide but Patterson's bio indicates other possibilities. Following her death, it came out in the tabloids that she had been secretly married to African-American Ike Jones since 1961. The couple was estranged at the time of her death.","October 18, 1934 in Stockholm, Sweden",1934-10-18,"Stockholm, Sweden","April 30, 1970 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA  (suicide by overdose)",1970-04-30,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA  ",suicide by overdose,"Ike Jones  (18 November 1961 - 30 April 1970) (her death)

nm0828523,K.T. Stevens,Gloria Wood,180,"She certainly had the requisite genes for an acting career as her father was the legendary director Sam Wood and her mother was a stage performer. K.T. Stevens wasted no time either. By the time she was 2 years old, she had made her film debut in her father's silent classic Peck's Bad Boy (1921), which starred Jackie Coogan. Christened Gloria Wood, she was billed ""Baby Gloria Wood"" as a toddler. Following high school, she decided to pursue acting full-time, taking drama lessons and apprenticing in summer stock. In 1938, she toured in two productions: ""You Can't Take It with You"" and ""My Sister Eileen"". The following year, she made her Broadway debut in a walk-on role in ""Summer Light"", which was directed by Lee Strasberg. At this point, she was calling herself ""Katharine Stevens"" (after her favorite actress, Katharine Hepburn), as she did not want to ride on her famous father's coattails. Eventually, she settled on the initials ""K.T."" which she felt added mystery and flair. Although her film career subsided, she flourished on radio (""Junior Miss"") and on the Broadway stage where ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"" (1940), ""Yankee Point"" (1942) and ""Nine Girls"" 1943) helped boost her reputation. K.T. met actor Hugh Marlowe after they appeared together on Broadway in ""The Land Is Bright"" (1941). Co-starring in a 1944 Chicago production of ""The Voice of the Turtle"", they married in 1946. The couple went on to grace more than 20 stage shows together, including a Broadway production of the classic film Vertigine (1944), in which she played the mysterious title role and he played the obsessed detective. In the 1950s, K.T. moved to TV episodics with Perry Mason (1957), Alfred Hitchcock presenta (1955) and La grande vallata (1965), just a few of her guest appearances. She possessed an open-faced prettiness and seemed ideal for film noir, but her chance to breakthrough never materialized despite decent roles in Kitty Foyle, ragazza innamorata (1940), which was directed by her father, L'ispiratrice (1942) starring Barbara Stanwyck, Il porto di New York (1949) with Yul Brynner, Squadra omicidi (1953) featuring Paulette Goddard and the sci-fi film Missili sulla luna (1958). Following her 1967 divorce from Marlowe, K.T. abandoned acting for a time in favor of teaching nursery school. She eventually returned to TV and made some strides in daytime soaps, most notably Febbre d'amore (1973). She also served three terms as President of the L.A. local branch of AFTRA. K.T. had two sons, Jeffrey Marlowe, born in 1948 and Christian, born in 1951, the latter best known these days as sportscaster Chris Marlowe.

After adapting Gore Vidal's ""The Left-Handed Gun"" to the screen in 1959, Stevens produced a low-budget melodrama, Private Property (1960), which starred his then-wife Kate Manx and was filmed at his Hollywood Hills home. The movie led to other work. In the early 1960s, Stevens was the head of Daystar Productions, one of the few independent TV production companies to survive amid the majors. Daystar created the Stoney Burke (1962) and The Outer Limits (1963) series. His 1965 movie Incubus (1966), which starred William Shatner and featured dialog spoken in Esperanto, was withdrawn from circulation by Stevens, who never released the movie beyond a few film festival showings. Stevens claimed in interviews that the deaths of two actors from the film made ""Incubus"" impossible for him to watch. In the 1970s, Stevens went on the payroll at Universal Studios and produced science-fiction series such as Buck Rogers (1979) and Gemini Man (1976).

nm0828594,Mark Stevens,Richard William Stevens,177,"Mark Stevens, a good-looking, second-tier star during the 1940s and 1950s, was born Richard William Stevens in Cleveland, Ohio, on December 13, 1916 (the dates in reference books seem to vary between 1915-20). Of Scottish and English heritage, the freckle-faced boy with the reddish hair had a father who was an American flyer. His parents divorced while he was young and Mark was sent to England where the rebellious boy found himself kicked out of several schools. He resided briefly with his maternal grandparents until a second move to Canada, where he was raised by his older sister. Slight in stature, Mark built himself up through athletics. A back injury, sustained while training as a Canadian Olympic diver, however, kept him from serving in WWII.His initial interest appeared to be art, which he studied for a time, but a gift for singing led to nightclub and theatre work, performing in musicals and legit plays throughout the various Canadian provinces. Radio broadcasting turned into another creative outlet for Mark. He eventually returned to his Ohio hometown in the early 1940s where he earned leading roles at the Cleveland Playhouse. Notice here on the stage eventually had him setting his sights on Hollywood. Being young and talented -- combined with a 4-F classification -- helped gain him a studio contract at a time when the major stars were assigned to military duty. Voted 5th as a promising ""star of tomorrow"" in 1946, he appeared sporadically on radio.He first became a contract player at Warner Brothers where he was groomed in bit parts as earnest soldier types and given the marquee name of Stephen Richards. That name was quickly changed by Darryl F. Zanuck to Mark Stevens, however, when Mark moved to the 20th Century-Fox lot. The studio also darkened his hair and covered up the freckles to enhance his serious good looks. He soon materialized into a prime film noir contender with such films as Gli ammutinati di Sing Sing (1945) and the excellent Grattacielo tragico (1946) (interestingly had the starring role but billed fourth in line), the latter pairing him up with a cast-against-type Lucille Ball several years before her Lucy ed io (1951) fame. One of Mark's finest hours on film was as an FBI man at odds with Richard Widmark in La strada senza nome (1948). He also co-starred as the altruistic husband of mental patient Olivia de Havilland in La fossa dei serpenti (1948).On the musical front, Mark appeared rather colorlessly in such tunefests as E ora chi bacerà (1947) and Dora bambola bionda! (1949), in which he was overshadowed by his leading ladies. Indeed, despite his good looks and abilities, Stevens was constantly (and unfairly) pigeonholed as a lesser version of John Payne or Alan Ladd. In retrospect, many of his capable performances leave viewers thinking he was a producer's casting Plan B. Securing a brief contract at Universal in 1951 where he appeared in such films as La danza proibita (1951) and Katie Did It (1950), Stevens later directed and starred in the ""B"" level crimer Cry Vengeance (1954) for Allied Artists.TV played a big part in his career in the 1950s, with two classic dramatic series coming his way. A move into producing (Mark Stevens Television, Inc.) and music publishing (Mark Stevens Music, Inc.) encouraged his retirement from acting, although he did occasionally appear in guest spots on such TV dramas as Carovane verso il west (1957) and Playhouse 90 (1956), while occasionally directing as well.

A great beauty as well as a great singer, she enjoyed one of the more successful careers of the many opera singers who made films, most notably in ""The Chocolate Soldier"" opposite Nelson Eddy and ""Going My Way"" with Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald. She was also something of a fixture on early TV, appearing frequently on such programs as ""The Bell Telephone Hour"" and ""The Voice of Firestone,"" where she sang both operatic arias and popular songs. She also appeared on one of the first telecasts from the Met, in 1954, singing Carmen opposite one of her most frequent Don Joses, Richard Tucker.Since her retirement from opera in 1960, she has continued to play a very active role in the New York fine arts scene. In 1964, she inaugurated the Music Theater of Lincoln Center as Anna Leonowens in a well-received revival of ""The King and I,"" produced by Richard Rodgers, opposite Darren McGavin 's King.

nm0828778,Shawn Stevens,Shawn Stevens,183,"Shawn Stevens (born April 5, 1958) is an American film, television and stage actor, singer and entrepreneur.Life Overview Shawn Stevens was born Shawn Perry Stevens in Morristown, New Jersey April 5, 1958, the first child of Gary Kieth Stevens, a carpenter, pilot and construction contractor, and Gladys Edna (Chich) Smith, a homemaker. Stevens lived in Morristown, New Jersey until his family moved to Burbank, Ca. in 1969. Stevens is the oldest of 3 children. He has a sister Jodi Beth (Blatz. b/1961) and brother Gary Kieth Jr. (b/1963). Stevens was raised Church of Christ and converted to Mormonism at age 19. Stevens married Kaylene McLaws in 1984 and together they have 4 children, Tauren-Ashlee (Tucker b. 1985), Shawn Kory (b. 1989), Perry Christian (b. 1981) and Vince Kayson (b. 1993). Shawn has 1 grandson and is expecting a 2nd in the summer of 2014. Shawn is uncle to actor/musician Kelly Blatz (One Square Mile, Aaron Stone, April Showers, and Prom Night).Jersey Boy Stevens' parents were very young and still in high school (Bernard's High, Bernardsville, New Jersey) when he was born and Shawn attended his parents' high school graduation. In his infancy Shawn spent a great deal of time with his maternal and paternal grandparents and extended family who all lived in the vicinity. From his paternal grandmother (Stevens' father's father passed away in 1961 when Shawn was 3 years old) and great-grandparents, Stevens developed a deep abiding faith in God. Stevens' great grandfather, Eddie Grindley, was a Church of Christ minister who founded several Christian summer camps (Camp Shiloh in Mendham, N.J and Camp Hunt near Hubbardsville, New York) primarily for inner-city youth from the boroughs of New York City. The singer/actor Pat Boone was a close family friend during these years. Through his maternal grandparents, who were Methodists, Stevens was schooled in music and the arts. Stevens' grandmother Alberta May (Trebilcock), or Nana, was a piano player while his grandfather Vince William Smith (a U.S. Navy Veteran of WW2) was a Wall Street banker, violinist and painter. Stevens' first exposure to live theater came when his Nana would take him to the nearby Papermill Playhouse in Milburn New Jersey to see children's plays and musicals, his favorite being The Frog Prince. Stevens also remembers seeing Raymond Burr in a live stage production and his first trip into New York City to see the world premiere of The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964 starring Debbie Reynolds who Shawn would later meet while in high school) at Radio City Music Hall with The Rockettes opening the show.As a child, Stevens remembers his first performance opportunity came in kindergarten (at South Street Elementary in Morristown New Jersey) as a clown in a school variety show. Shawn noticed that the older boy who was playing the ""strong man"" had left his bar bells on the stage. Not wanting to see the show ruined by the prop being left on stage, Shawn rushed out to center stage and retrieved the fake weights with one hand. To his amazement the audience broke out in laughter and applause. Stevens bowed and 'a ham was born'. Shawn knew that this was what he wanted to do with his life. Stevens would follow up his New Jersey elementary school acting ""career"" with portrayals of The Mighty Oak in The Oak and the Reed and as a Dwarf in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Stevens also developed a love for singing and would enjoy singing holiday and patriotic songs when prompted by his teachers. Stevens remembers singing America the Beautiful in front of his 2nd grade class. When funding was cut for music instruction in school Shawn jumped in and prevailed on the teacher to let him take over. Shawn remembers teaching his classmates songs like Born Free and Edelweiss. Stevens would also conduct acapella hymn singing (Church of Christ does not have instrumental music) in his church congregation as early as 10 years of age.The Wonder Full Years When Stevens was 10 his family moved to California so his father could pursue career opportunities. Stevens felt that this was fortuitous for his desire to have a performing career as well. (Shawn remembers his parting words to his friends when driving away from his home as ""watch for me on TV!""). Within months of landing in Burbank, California (home of Walt Disney, Universal, Warner Bros. and NBC Studios) Shawn had hand written a letter to Walt Disney introducing himself, and with the help of a friend's father (who worked at Disney) delivered the letter to Mr. Disney's office. Although this didn't lead to a personal meeting with Mr. Disney, the letter was passed off to the head of the Disney children's casting office and a meeting was granted. He was told to get some more experience and to be in every local and school production possible and that the time would come. That's all Shawn needed to hear. That summer, Shawn's elementary school, Thomas Jefferson Elementary, was making a film as a summer activity of The Wizard of Oz. Shawn wanted to play his favorite character, The Cowardly Lion, and the audition criteria was whoever made the best costume got the part. Shawn and his mom set about dyeing pajamas, attaching fake nails to socks and fashioning yarn to make a wig and mane. Their efforts paid off and Shawn was in his glory that summer hamming it up in front of the 16 mm camera. Through another family friend that year Shawn heard about a local theater, The Glendale Centre Theatre, in neighboring Glendale, California that was casting a production of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Shawn auditioned and was cast as The Spirit of Christmas Past, a role generally played by an adult. This production played to a sold out house of 350+ patrons nightly for 6 weeks. Shawn had found a home! Stevens remained the resident young male actor at GCT through his adolescence and teens, oft times taking the bus to and from the theater, performing in every play possible including The Remarkable Mister Pennypacker, I Remember Mama, Up the Down Staircase, Turn 'Round West Wind and the annual A Christmas Carol, maturing into multiple roles (Shawn's wife and children would later appear in the production making it a family affair. Life would come full circle!) Stevens was simultaneously highly involved in his junior high school (John Muir Jr. High) and senior high school (Burbank Senior High, class of 1976) drama, choral music and, even, band departments (Shawn took up playing the bass drum) where he sang barbershop, men's, mixed, and madrigal music (Shawn was awarded Best Male Vocalist for 4 straight years), played in marching band, and played leads in such plays as Barefoot in the Park, Bad Seed, David and Lisa (directed by classmate Tim Burton) and, his personal favorite, portrayed Prof. Harold Hill in Meredith Wilson's The Music Man. Other high school musical highlights including Shawn receiving a vocal scholarship to Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts, where Shawn won the coveted opportunity to sing the school Alma Mater at commencement, and participation in the Southern California and All-State Honor Choirs, the latter directed by Roger Wagner (of the world famous Roger Wagner Choral). Not one to waste time during his summer breaks from high school, Shawn participated in the Teenage Drama Workshop at California State, Northridge where he would study musical theater. Another alum from this program, who would become a great friend, is the award winning actress Mare Winningham (Amber Waves, Hatfields and McCoys).Adversity and Opportunity At age 13 Shawn had back to back removal of his tonsils and appendix and, when his mother offered him a treat for having endured going under the knife, asked if he could have voice lessons. He began taking voice lessons, with an emphasis on musical theater. (He would later study with Seth Riggs, Nolan Van Way and David Craig.) As a side note, Shawn had several illnesses during his teen years and was forced to miss school for extended periods of time. Although he did keep up with his schoolwork from home he also used this time to watch the many classic movies that used to play on television during the daytime and evenings. He would develop a deep respect and admiration for the great actors from the golden age of film and would put many of the great scenes and monologues to memory. Henry Fonda, Orson Welles and Jimmy Stewart were among his favorites and he was overjoyed at the prospects of meeting and perhaps working with them someday, which he was able to accomplish. He even met Debbie Reynolds by whom he had been mesmerized as a youth while watching her onscreen at the Radio City Music Hall in The Unsinkable Molly Brown. Again, his young life had come full circle!On The Road During his senior year of high school, Stevens auditioned for and was invited to join the singing group ""The Young Americans' where he participated in their summer repertory group ""Torchlite Musical Theater"" in Petosky, Michigan. During his first summer away from home he played a variety of roles in the musicals George M., Oklahoma, GODSPEL, and The Music Man. Stevens was also invited to tour with the group in a 9 month, 165 city, 48 state tour which he says was one of the most grueling experiences of his life.(Shawn's only post high school educational experience came in the form of a semester at Los Angeles Valley College where he participated in the musical Fiddler on the Roof in the role of Perchik.)After landing back in L.A., Stevens auditioned for a role which was to change the course of his life. A family friend knew of a director who was looking for a young man to play the lead in a low-budget independent feature. The film was called ""No Place to Ride"" and was a thriller about 3 friends being terrorized by a crazed killer while dirt biking in the southeastern badlands of Utah. Shawn was offered the part and was off to Utah (Kanab) for 6 weeks. It was while in Utah that Stevens had the opportunity to witness Mormonism at work and where he developed the desire to investigate the LDS Church further when he returned to Los Angeles. This led to his becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon) in 1977 at age 19. (About this time Shawn also signed with personal manager, Bonnie Larson (also LDS), who would groom Shawn and place him with noted theatrical agent Arnold Soloway at The Artist Group.) Shortly after becoming a Mormon and setting out on his new faith journey Shawn was offered the leading role of Jimmy in the LDS landmark musical ""Saturday's Warrior"", with which he toured the western United States for the next year.Big Break Stevens' big break into television came in the summer of 1978 when he landed the leading role in the William Blinn (Brian's Song, Roots, 8 is Enough, Starsky and Hutch) penned and produced series ""The Mackenzies of Paradise Cove"" for ABC. The series was filmed entirely in Hawaii and co-starred Clu Gulager (The Virginian), Sean Marshall (Pete's Dragon) and Keith Coogan (Adventures in Babysitting). Although the series only lasted 1 season, it was enough to catapult Stevens into the spotlight. Shawn was quickly picked up by the teen magazines and in 1980, at the non-teen age of 20, was named the most popular ""Teen Idol"" by Laufer Publications (Tiger Beat, Teen Beat) due to the tremendous amount of fan mail he received at their offices. Shawn would continue to dominate the covers and pages of teen targeted publications through the mid 80's.Career Stevens continued to work on television and in films (see filmography) continuously throughout the early and mid '80's. He appeared in a wide variety of genres and acting styles including soaps, sit-coms, afterschool specials, episodic, and mini-series' and would appear as himself on game shows, talk shows, and telethons. Shawn would eagerly use his ""celebrity"" status to participate in charitable causes such as being a national spokesman for the March of Dimes' Walk America and also serving as host for 4 years of the Miss Teen USA Pageant. One of Shawn's most rewarding experiences was when he was invited to be the guest of honor and perform at a fundraiser for the Morristown N.J. chapter of Birthright. He was surprised to have the date proclaimed ""Shawn Stevens Day"" in his hometown and to be given the Key to the City by the mayor. In addition to acting, Shawn was simultaneously pursuing a singing career. He was featured as a singer in numerous live events across the country and on television. It was while singing on the soap opera Search for Tomorrow (Shawn's character sang live 2 to 3 times a week) that Shawn caught the attention of iconic record producer Michael Lloyd (Shaun Cassidy, Debbie Boone, Leif Garrett, and The Osmonds) and was signed to a recording contract with Warner/Curb Records. Not one to rest on his laurels, Shawn always had the dream of giving back and starting a children's theater like the one that had inspired him as a child. In 1983 Shawn turned the dream into a reality when he founded The Children's Theater of Los Angeles with the assistance of Magic Castle founder Milt Larsen. Mr. Larsen also owned the historic Variety Arts Theater in downtown Los Angeles which became the home of the CTLA. The inaugural production of the CTLA was an original musical called I Will which followed a group of children into the Tudorian world of William Shakespeare. Although a critical success, the show lost money and the support of backers and Shawn was forced to reconsider his foray into the world of children's theater. The theater company closed after it's second production, Big Time.Focus on Family In 1983 Shawn met the love of his life, Kaylene McLaws, (a fashion designer within the garment industry) at church and after a year's courtship they were married June 16, 1984. Together they have 4 children (Tauren-Ashlee b. 1985 (married Dylan Tucker 2012), Shawn Kory Albert b. 1989 (married Mallory Peterson 2011), Perry Christian Garack b. 1991, Vince Kayson Clark b. 1993) and have one grandchild, Shawn Jeremiah, and are expecting a second, Jack Dylan, in the summer of 2014. In 1987 Shawn participated in an LDS missionary film called ""Our Heavenly Father's Plan"" and, after searching his conscience, decided to voluntarily put his professional career on the shelf so as to allow the film to serve its purpose worldwide. Shawn also took this as an opportunity to pursue other interests and focus on his family and personal growth.Second Act In 2012, after 25 years offstage, Shawn was given the opportunity to audition for the legendary 50's and 60's doo wop group The Diamonds (Li'l Darlin', The Stroll) and was invited to perform with them during a 4 month engagement headlining the world famous Palm Springs Follies. During this experience Shawn remembered how much he missed and loved performing and, with the love and support of his family, decided to set about returning to his passion. Shawn will be appearing in the T.C.

Her acting talent, however, never measured up and, within a few years, she willingly retired.Born in London on March 10, 1938, Venetia came from strong entertainment stock. Her mother, actress Anna Lee, was a well-known co-star of the British cinema, and her father, director Robert Stevenson, was well-respected for his directing of such classy Grade ""A"" motion pictures as Destino di sangue (1936), King Solomon's Mines (1937), Gli amanti (1941) and La porta proibita (1943). Just prior to the beginning of WWII in Europe, the family moved to Hollywood. By 1944, her parents had divorced and Venetia, eventually, decided to live with her father and new stepmother.Venetia's photogenic beauty was apparent from the start. As part of the youthful Hollywood scene, she was quickly discovered and moved with ease into junior modeling work. This, plus her parents' obvious connections, led to a natural progression into acting. Self-admittedly, she was never a confidant actress. Making her TV debut playing a corpse on Matinee Theater (1955), she also appeared with her mother and the husband/wife team of Fernando Lamas and Arlene Dahl in a 1955 Arizona stage production of ""Liliom"", in order to gain experience. Signed with RKO, Venetia took acting lessons and posed for publicity stills but she made little progress there. Warner Bros. eventually took her on and she made several guest appearances on TV, including that of Ricky Nelson's girlfriend on the popular series, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952). Other WB series work included roles on Cheyenne (1955) and Indirizzo permanente (1958).Venetia made her film entrance with a decorous, second-lead femme role in the WB war picture Commandos (1958), starring James Garner, Peter Brown and Edd Byrnes. As part of the Hollywood dating swirl, there were obvious set-ups with such big stars as Tab Hunter, Anthony Perkins and, even, Elvis Presley. Such a set-up led to a 1956 marriage to up-and-coming actor/dancer Russ Tamblyn, but the bloom quickly fell off the rose and the couple divorced a year later.For the most part. Venetia was cast as a beautiful distraction in action-adventure and crime movies. Her handful of hunky movie co-stars included Jeff Richards and Guy Madison. Such routine roles in La notte senza legge (1959), L'isola delle vergini (1959), Vivi con rabbia (1960), Sette strade al tramonto (1960), La città dei morti (1960), which was made in her native England and released here as ""Horror Hotel"", and Mille donne e un caporale (1961), her last, did little to boost her feelings of adequacy or her Hollywood ranking. Mother Anna Lee, who found renewed recognition as a daytime soap doyenne (""Lila Quartermaine"" on General Hospital (1963)), appeared in support of her daughter in two films: Il ritorno dell'assassino (1959) and Il canale della morte (1960). Divorced from Tamblyn, Venetia married one of The Everly Brothers, Don Everly, of ""Wake Up, Little Susie"" fame, in 1962. At this point, she had no qualms about retiring from the ever-competitive acting world and did so. The couple went on to have two daughters and a son. Stacy Everly and Erin Everly both dabbled in acting, and son Edan Everly delved into music as both a singer and guitarist. He also teaches music and produces/writes for other artists.In later years, Venetia became a script reader for Burt Reynolds's production company and, subsequently, became vice-president of Cinema Group, a production company that made several films in the 1980s. Since her 1970 divorce from Everly, the still-beautiful lady, who enjoys horseback riding, has not remarried.","March 10, 1938 in London, England, UK",1938-03-10,"London, England, UK",,,,,"Don Everly  (13 February 1962 - 1970) (divorced) (3 children)

While in college she also studied at the prestigious La Jolla Playhouse Summer Conservatory under Tony Award-winning director Anna Shapiro. This experience propelled her decision to pursue acting as a career, even though she had already been accepted to several law schools.She is often termed a ""chameleon"" for her ability to morph from character to character and traverse multiple genres. This unique skill set first got Amy noticed for her tear jerking performance as a rape victim in a critically acclaimed episode of David E. Kelley's The Practice. Since then, Amy has continued to appear on some of the most popular dramas on television.Ironically, Stewart is a natural ""funny girl,"" with training in both improv and stand-up comedy. Her breakout comedic film performance came in the screwball romantic comedy Monkey Love, described by IndieWire as ""a late night secret pleasure for single gals with bad track records."" She starred in the film opposite Jeremy Renner, and proved that she is as diverse as she is talented.

nm0829359,Elaine Stewart,Elsy Henrietta Maria Steinberg,169,"Ravishing redhead Elaine Stewart came onto the film scene in the early 1950s and decorated a number of eastern and western films as well as crimers as a second-tier MGM star. Her striking, shapely beauty and ""come hither"" sensuality was on full display throughout the decade, often as a temptress or schemer. By the early 1960s, however, she had faded from view, prompted by her 1963 marriage to a game show producer. She then came out of her Beverly Hills retirement in the early 1970s made a modest return to TV in the 70s charming daytime audiences on the game show circuit.Elaine was born Elsy Henrietta Maria Steinberg on May 31, 1930 in Montclair, N.J., the daughter of German immigrants, Maria Hedwig (Hänssler) and Ulrich Ernst Steinberg, a police sergeant, who was of Frisian background. A one-time usherette and cashier at her hometown movie theatre. Elaine developed very quickly into a beautiful young woman. After a brief stint as a medical assistant, and while still a teen, she was eventually taken on by the Conover Modeling Agency. Changing her name to the more glamorous-sounding Elaine Stewart, her whistle-worthy portfolio and beauty awards eventually caught the attention of Hollywood executives.Movie mogul Hal B. Wallis offered the wannabe starlet the small, unbilled role of a nurse in the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis slapstick comedy Attente ai marinai! (1952). MGM subsequently signed the glamour girl to a contract with the intention of building her up as a dark-haired Marilyn Monroe type. The build-up was gradual with window-dressing bits as a chorine, stewardess and the like in such MGM films as Cantando sotto la pioggia (1952), You for Me (1952) and La ragazza della domenica (1952). She then moved up the movie ladder to more visible parts in Sky Full of Moon (1952) and, most pointedly, as Lila, the sexy lush and opportunist who has a marvelous ""descending staircase"" bit in Il bruto e la bella (1952). During this time, she became a popular pin-up and made the cover of Life Magazine. She later appeared nude on the Playboy Magazine pages (September, 1959).She hit sultry ""B"" co-star status the following year in the semi-documentary-styled police drama Prendeteli vivi o morti (1953) opposite Ralph Meeker, appeared briefly as the ill-fated queen ""Anne Boleyn"", mother to ""Queen Elizabeth"" in the Jean Simmons starrer La regina vergine (1953); provided lovely distraction in the macho war film Femmina contesa (1953) alongside Richard Widmark; played a princess-in-peril in Le avventure di Hajji Babà (1954) and, co-starring with Gene Kelly and Van Johnson, glamoured up the musical Brigadoon (1954). She left MGM around 1956, and finished off the decade with the films Passaggio di notte (1957), Il vestito strappato (1957) and Selvaggio west (1959). In the early 1960s, she made a couple of films both here and abroad and her standard sultry allure could be witnessed on such TV dramas as Burke's Law (1963) and Perry Mason (1957).Briefly married to actor Bill Carter in the early 1960s, she later wed Emmy Award-winning game show creator Merrill Heatter and left her career to raise two children. In 1972, she became a co-hostess of the Heatter-Quigley game show Gambit (1972) with perennial game show emcee Wink Martindale and later partnered in the dice-rolling gamer High Rollers (1975) with Alex Trebek.Following an extended illness, the actress died in Beverly Hills at the age of 81 in June of 2011.

nm0829717,Paul Stewart,Paul Sternberg,178,"Esteemed character actor Paul Stewart had a pair of the coldest orbs in town and made his living for decades playing dark, callous, shiftless villains, including a vast number of mobsters. Not a well-known name per se, he was nevertheless a reliable actor who seemed to have been born for the film noir and gangland crime drama genre with his premature silvery hair, dark thick brows and probing, deep-set eyes, all accentuated by a tough and penetrating Brooklyn accent.Born in New York City on March 13, 1908, Stewart developed an interest for acting in his teens, making his Broadway debut with ""Two Seconds"" in 1931, following graduation from Columbia University. He had played a few more stage roles in New York when he met and made an impression on Orson Welles. As a result he became a founding member of the Mercury Theatre and a founding member of AFTRA when it was just a radio union. Stewart's tough, guttural voice became a familiar sound on the 1930s airwaves and he was among the cast in the infamous Welles broadcast ""The War of the Worlds."" He married band singer/actress Peg La Centra (1910-1996) in 1939 and over the years they appeared together on many radio programs. She also provided singing voices for such stars as Susan Hayward on celluloid. Welles next put Stewart in his films, with the classic Quarto potere (1941) as Raymond, Kane's wily valet, and Stewart found himself in demand as an untrustworthy character player. He essayed a number of stark, sinister types to perfection, with roles in such films as Sorvegliato speciale (1941), La dama e l'avventuriero (1943), Il grande campione (1949), Trafficanti d'uomini (1949), Cielo di fuoco (1949), Carabina Williams (1952), Il bruto e la bella (1952) and Un bacio e una pistola (1955). On TV he became a regular on a couple of short-lived series -- Top Secret (1954) and The Man Who Never Was (1966). In the 1950s Stewart turned to stage and TV directing as well, helming a number of popular crimers such as Peter Gunn (1958), Michael Shayne (1960), Operazione ladro (1968), Hawaii Five-O (1968) and Mai dire sì (1982). His voice also fit the bill for cartoons in the 1960s. In 1974 Stewart suffered a heart attack while on location in New Mexico for Stringi i denti e vai! (1975), but he returned sporadically to films, including the role of impresario Florenz Ziegfeld in W.C. Fields and Me (1976). He suffered a second and fatal heart attack in 1986 at age 77.","March 13, 1908 in New York City, New York, USA",1908-03-13,"New York City, New York, USA","February 17, 1986 in Los Angeles, California, USA  (heart attack)",1986-02-17,"Los Angeles, California, USA  ",heart attack,Peg La Centra  (14 January 1939 - 17 February 1986) (his death),1,0,0,0

Peggy's mother eventually married a wealthy attorney named Stewart, and Peggy took his name. She grew up in Atlanta (where she developed the athletic skills she would later demonstrate in her many westerns for Republic Pictures). On a family vacation to Los Angeles to visit her grandmother, Peggy, as a lark, attended classes at a dramatic school, but the acting bug hit her hard and when it was time to return to Atlanta, Peggy talked her mother into letting her staying with her grandmother. As luck would have it, a resident of the apartment building they lived in was character actor Henry O'Neill, who took a liking to Peggy and got her cast in her first film, Un mondo che sorge (1937). She picked up a few more small roles, and acquitted herself so well the parts started getting bigger and she was working more often. She married actor Don 'Red' Barry in 1940, and was eventually signed by Republic Pictures, Barry's studio, to make westerns and serials. In three years, Peggy did almost 30 films at Republic, most of them westerns. She appeared in two of the studio's more successful serials, but when Republic assigned her to another one, she protested. She didn't particularly like working in serials, preferring the feature westerns, which didn't take as long to film. Eventually, the struggle with Republic got to the point where Peggy asked for her release, and she got it. Although she wanted to start doing films other than westerns, she had made so many at Republic that she found herself basically unable to find work in any other genre. She freelanced for Monogram, Allied Artists, PRC and other small studios until she was picked up by Columbia--which immediately put her into serials. She eventually decided to leave the film business, and did so in 1953. She did do some television work (mostly westerns!) while raising her family, and also performed in the Los Angeles theatrical community. She kept her hand in the film business, making occasional appearances in some lower-budget westerns, made-for-TV movies and inexpensive horror pictures.","June 5, 1923 in Palm Beach, Florida, USA",1923-06-05,"Palm Beach, Florida, USA","May 29, 2019 in Valencia, California, USA",2019-05-29,"Valencia, California, USA",,"Buck Young  (4 March 1953 - 9 February 2000) (his death) (2 children)

He had to give up his dream of becoming a professional hockey player and so he in fact fell into the entertainment business by accident. The injury forced him to turn down a number of athletic scholarships he had been offered. So, to put himself through the University of Waterloo, where he majored in Latin and English he took up his guitar, set some poems to music and sang in local restaurants.

She modeled in fashion advertisements and one ad led to a screen test. She was cast as a model in Ciao bellezza!

Despite having no experience in the kind of stunts and athletics that would be required, Stirling was able to convince not only the executives but ace stuntman Yakima Canutt of her capability. She won the role and a contract from Republic, and played hard-riding and -fighting heroines in numerous serials, Westerns, and low-budget adventure films over the next three or four years.

Nigel was educated at St. Paul's School and studied for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he earned the Leverhulme Exhibition, Northcliffe Scholarship, and the Principal's Medal. He made his debut stage appearance at the Savoy Theatre in 1931, at the age of 12, in a production of ""The Traveller in the Dark"". He continued to rack up a number of classical and contemporary credits at various distinguished theaters, including the Old Vic, with productions of ""The Winter's Tale"", ""Macbeth"" (playing Macduff), ""Tobacco Road"" and ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"". Stock interrupted his thriving career by serving in the Army from 1939 to 1941 with the London Irish Rifles, and with the Assam Regiment, Indian Army between 1941 and 1945 in Burma, China and Kohima. He was honorably discharged with the rank of Major. He returned to the stage in 1946 with ""And No Birds Sing"" and made his first appearance on the New York stage as ""Philip"" in ""You Never Can Tell"" in 1948. A reliable player who lent distinction to every aspect of the theatrical repertoire, from William Shakespeare through Anton Chekhov to modern farce, he impressed in ""She Stoops to Conquer"", ""The Caine Mutiny Court Martial"", ""Altona"", ""Uncle Vanya"" and ""Sleuth"", among others.

nm0830868,Cynthia Stockley,Cynthia Stockley,,"According to most sources British author Cynthia Stockley was born in London around 1863 with the birth name Lilian Julian Webb. She could have been the oldest daughter of Frederick I. and Mary A. Webb. Their daughter is the only Lilian (or Lillian) Webb found in the 1871 English Census who was born in London around 1863. At that time of the 1871 census Frederick Webb was a schoolmaster in the village of Charles in the county of Devon. By the 1891 census his daughter Lilian was working as a teacher at a boarding school in London. This may or may not be the correct family connection. Also most of the news accounts at the time of her death believed that Stockley had been born in South Africa.In 1896 Cynthia Stockley relocated to the then British colony of Rhodesia. There she married Rhodesian police officer Phillip George Watts Stockley and later Colonel H. E. Pelham-Browne, one of the earliest European settlers of Rhodesia.Sometime around the turn of the twentieth century Stockley returned to England and began working as a newspaper writer. Her first book, ""Virginia of Rhodesians"" (1904), was a collection of short stories that achieved international success. Later ""Poppy, The Story of a South African Girl"" (1910), received a great deal of attention for its frankness about marriage, morality, sex and depression. A list of some of her later books include: ""The Claw: Stories of South Africa"" (1911), ""The Dream Ship"" (1913), ""Wild Honey: Stories of South Africa"""" (1914), ""Blue Aloes: Stories of South Africa"" (1918), ""Pink Gods and Blue Demons"" (1920), ""The Sins of Rosanne"" (1920), ""Ponjola"" (1923), ""Dalla The Lion-Cub: Stories of South Africa.""

Her fading popularity and reduced financial circumstances may have played a factor in her death. Some believe that had her stories not revolved so much around colonial life in Africa that she might be better remembered today.","July 7, 1873 in Bloomfontein, South Africa",1873-07-07,"Bloomfontein, South Africa","January 15, 1936 in London, England, UK  (suicide by gas)",1936-01-15,"London, England, UK  ",suicide by gas,"Joseph Byrne  (1905 - ?) (1 child)

The son of singing performer Harry Stockwell and Nina Olivette (she also went by the name Betty Veronica), their mother sent both Dean and Guy to an open call for a 1943 Broadway show entitled ""The Innocent Voyage,"" which was to star famed acting teacher Herbert Berghof. The play needed about a dozen children and, by chance, both boys were cast. Dean went immediately into films for MGM and became a popular post-war child star while Guy had to wait until adulthood before coming into his own. Following high school he attended the University of California where he majored in psychology and philosophy.Guy started his career off in minor film and TV bits, then was given his big break in 1961 as a regular cast member of the outdoor sea adventure Adventures in Paradise (1959) as first mate to star Gardner McKay. He played the role for one season. Following that in 1963 he became one of 11 performers who made up the company for Richard Boone's television anthology series. Guy became a Universal contract player in 1965 and went straight into several standard tales of adventure and intrigue, including Il principe guerriero (1965), Tobruk (1967) and L'affare Blindfold (1966). Initially promoted as a dashing Errol Flynn type in swordplay adventures and outdoor epics, the studio had him star in the remake of Gary Cooper's French Foreign Legion classic Beau Geste (1966) opposite another film up-and-comer Doug McClure. He co-starred with McClure again, this time as the villain, in Il pirata del re (1967) while vying for beauties Jill St. John and Mary Ann Mobley. He also earned the role of Buffalo Bill Cody in a remake of Cooper's I dominatori della prateria (1966). Playing a villain again in the glossy soaper Il club degli intrighi (1967) with Robert Wagner and Ms. St. John, most of Guy's high-profile roles came off routine at best and the films failed at the box office. He made his last picture for Universal co-starring with Anthony Franciosa in Spie oltre il fronte (1968) before his contract ended.Guy subsequently gravitated towards the small screen and local stage. He created the Los Angeles Art Theater along the way where he played leading roles in well-received productions of ""Hamlet"" and his own adaptation of ""Crime and Punishment."". Gaining respect in later years as an acting teacher, he wrote a textbook for actors called Cold Reading Advantage (1991) and taught acting (as an alumnus at the University of California) for two years in their masters program. Subsequent character parts in films were a bit offbeat to say the least, having gained some weight over time. He was also involved in extensive voice-over work.Married and divorced three times, he had two children, Doug and Victoria, by first wife Susan; an adopted son, Kerry, by second wife Sandy; and had several stepchildren by his marriage to third wife Olga. Guy suffered from diabetes in later years and died of complications in 2002.

After more than 30 roles in the theatre, since 1980 Veliko Stoianov has become entirely movie actor. He made his début in the cinema as early as he was a student. In 1970 the Italian film of Valentino Orsini 'The Lover Of the Great Bear', starring Julliano Jemma was shooted in Bulgaria. Veliko Stoianov was invited for the part of Bolko-fold. No doubt, the year 1978 was a great one in the artistic development of the actor, mostly because of his participation in Ivan Terziev,s TV serial 'The Hamlet', written by great Bulgarian poet Konstantin Pavlov. This work has not lost its unique importance in the history of Bulgarian TV films even nowadays. Its subject deals with the problem of Stalinist perversities in Bulgarian villages. The film was banned for 11 years and was warmly applauded at the first-night performance, which took place immediately after the fall of the communist regime in Bulgaria. Acted one of the major characters in the serial Veliko Stoianov succeeded to perform a complex, psychologically shaded role - eccentric, calling for sympathy and tragic at the same time. The actor has been appreciated not only for his impressive appearance, but also for his high professionalism.

nm0831288,Austin Stoker,Austin Stoker,180,"Leading and supporting African-American actor, Austin Stoker has been recognized since the 70s. Born and raised in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, West Indies, he attributes his affinity for the performing arts to being - since age 6 - a devoted participant in the over two-hundred-year-old Trinidad carnival - reportedly ""The World's Most Colorful Festival"". At 16, Austin's dream was to attend London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. That dream never came true. But as chance would have it, he was invited to join the Geoffrey Holder Dance Group in his Trinidad home-town, which brought him to New york and landed in a Broadway show playing the steel-drum, the musical instrument invented in Trinidad. As an all-round percussionist and singer, Austin worked with the group steadily for three years in concerts and clubs, until he was drafted into the U.S. Army. Upon his return to civilian life, he became a Permanment U.S. Resident and eventually began his dramatic training at New York's HB Studio, culminating in a scholarship under the tutelage of the distinguished exegete and author, Ms. Uta Hagen. While performing on-screen, he has also been active consistently on the stage as well. His first major role on-screen is probably that of Anno 2670 - Ultimo atto (1973) playing MacDonald. He later returned for the short-lived TV series Return to the Planet of the Apes (1975) and a short role in Airport 75 (1974). His parts, however, got him the attention of a couple of ""blaxploitation"" directors of the early 70s. He took the lead role in the exploitation thriller Zebra Killer (1974) and Abby ...la storia di una donna posseduta! (1974) and as Pam Grier's undercover sidekick and lover in the hit film 'Sheba, Baby' (1975), all three films directed by the late William Girdler. But Austin has probably mostly been recognized and remembered for his lead performance as Lt. Ethan Bishop whose police station is besieged by a gang in John Carpenter's Distretto 13: le brigate della morte (1976). He eventually took co-star and supporting roles in the late 70s to the early 80s in films like Time Walker (1982) and did numerous guest appearances on popular television shows. Although Austin's activity in films in recent years has been less than he would prefer, he continues to work on stage.","October 7, 1943 in Trinidad, British West Indies [now Trinidad and Tobago]",1943-10-07,"Trinidad, British West Indies [now Trinidad and Tobago]",,,,,Vivian Bonnell  (1959 - ?),1,0,0,0

nm0831321,Chris Stokes,Chris Stokes,,"Chris Stokes BioEntrepreneur Christopher B. Stokes has made a name for himself in the music industry with the discovery of such stars as Brandy, Immature, B2K, Jhene Aiko, Sevyn Streeter, Mila J, Kevin McHale (Glee), Omarion & Marques Houston. A Los Angeles native, Stokes has been immersed in the music business since the age of seventeen. Known for his ingenuity behind chart-topping success stories such as multi-platinum selling groups ""B2K"" and ""Immature"" and solo artists ""Omarion"" (former lead singer of ""B2K"") and Marques ""MH"" Houston (former lead singer of ""Immature""/""IMX""), Stokes continues his meteoric rise in the music.Stokes began his career in music at the young age of 12, singing in different groups and talent shows. His mother Irene ""Mama Stokes"" was an actress/comedienne, which gave Stokes his early interest in the entertainment industry. Stokes later realized that his passion was in the management field. He knew he had a great eye for new talent when he landed his first record deal with a group he was managing called ""Next Issue."" That situation didn't work out, but it gave Stokes the experience and determination to make his stamp in the music industry as a force to be reckoned with. As his career furthered, Stokes went on to discover the 90's Boy Group sensation Immature. While working with Immature, Stokes was introduced to singer, rapper and dancer Mila J. Later signed by Stokes, Mila J and her two group members landed a deal with the MCA label in 1995 under the name Gyrl. Gyrl disbanded and Mila J went on to be in another Stokes created girl group called Dame Four. In 2006, Mila J was signed as a solo act at Motown under the direction of music mogul Sylvia Rhone to work on what was set to be her first solo album, Split Personality. However, due to creative differences, the album was not released. In late 2012, Mila J went into the studio and put out a mix tape of 5 songs. The mix tape exploded obtaining over 600,000 downloads, causing a stir within industry insiders who then took note. In 2013, Mila J was the talk of every major label in town, but decided to re-sign to Motown. Her first single under Motown ""Smoke, Drink, Break-Up"" was released in February 2014 and immediately began climbing the R&B Chart. In the 00's Stokes also founded the hit boy group B2K. It was during this time that Stokes discovered and began working with Jhene Aiko. Stokes met the young songstress when she was only 5 years old. He instantly knew that she was a star and would one day be a huge success in the music business. Stokes artist developed Jhene until she was ready and old enough to take her place in the industry which began with Stokes getting her signed to Epic Records through his then production company TUG (The Ultimate Group). Some time after leaving Epic she and Stokes mutually decided to part ways. Taking some time to further develop herself Jhene Aiko released a very successful mixtape called ""Sailing Souls"" and on to a chart topping R&B hit ""The Worst"". Stokes also served as Vice President of A&M/Interscope Records. During his tenure at A&M/Interscope, Stokes assembled the girl group TG4 and signed them to T.U.G. Entertainment, where Stokes served as their manager. He offered Amber (Sevyn) Streeter the first spot in the group after she opened for B2K and IMX at a concert in Orlando, Florida in early 2001. The group later went on to be signed by A&M records. Unfortunately the group did not achieve the success that Stokes had hoped for and they later disbanded. Amber (Sevyn) Streeter went on to pursue a career in songwriting where she wrote several chart topping hits for artists like Chris Brown and Ariana Grande. She also began a successful solo career under the name Sevyn Streeter. Stokes also helped actor/singer Glee star Kevin McHale get his start in the business. Stokes discovered Kevin back in 2001 at the age of 13. Stokes helped mold him into a solid performer and put him into the boy band NLT, which led to Kevin's major role as Artie Abrams on the hit Fox television show Glee. Involved in every step of the creative process with his artists, Stokes is an accomplished songwriter as well. He has contributed to tracks for superstar groups Destiny's Child, B2K, BBD and Immature, and has also written and produced for Bobby Brown, Omarion and Marques Houston.Without a doubt one of the most influential players in R&B music, Stokes' creative ventures extend well beyond his music roots. In 2003, Stokes made his feature writing/directing debut with the super successful ""You Got Served"". That film surprised Hollywood, opening at #1 and continuing to dominate even in its 2nd weekend. ""You Got Served"" went on to gross more than $150 million worldwide in box office and DVD combined. The dance film and it's success ignited a spark throughout the dance community and gave a breath of life to the dance culture in the industry and worldwide. Stokes has also directed more than 150 music videos for artists on his label as well as artists from other labels.If that wasn't enough, Stokes ventured into the Clothing industry for a bit with Christopher Brian, a high-end apparel line. Stokes gave mega reality TV star Kim Kardashian her first multi-million dollar modeling job as the spokes model for Christopher Brian Apparel. E! did a news special on Chris Stokes and his clothing line featuring very racy, sexy but tasteful pictures of a topless Kim wearing just the CB jeans. The special also included Kim Kardashian. Shortly after, Kim Kardashian and her family went on to do the hit series ""Keepin Up With The Kardashians"". Chris Stokes has been the creative director for the line since its inception, and it represents his vision of luxurious, beautiful clothes for men and women. Deemed ""the brand for the million-dollar man,"" the collection was a huge success at the MAGIC trade show in Las Vegas in 2007. Hundreds of celebrities packed Body English at the Hard Rock Hotel to launch the line, which featured a special performance from super producer Timbaland. A year after starting, Stokes inked a lucrative deal to sell the popular line.In 2007 Stokes directed the horror film ""Somebody Help Me"" which starred Omarion and Marques Houston. In addition to directing the film, Stokes also wrote the script. The film was released to DVD on November 13, 2007 and made a television premiere on BET on Halloween 2007. In 2010, Stokes went back to his experience in the horror genre and wrote and directed the sequel to ""Somebody Help Me"", ""Somebody Help Me 2"". The sequel reunited Stokes with Sonny King (Corbin), Omarion (Darryl) and Marques Houston (Brendan) and picks up where the first installment left off. The film made it's television premiere on BET on October 29, 2010 and did really well on DVD. The success of the horror genre continued for Stokes with the Grindstone/Lionsgate release of his new film ""No Vacancy"". Stokes also continued with the Dance genre in 2012 with the hit kids dance battle film ""Battlefield America"". The film featured the introduction of young star Camren Bicondova who Stokes also discovered. ""I remember I had to convince Camren and her mother to let her act in the film."" Says Stokes. ""Camren was hired as a dancer, but I felt like she was a mega star. So I wrote her into the film as one of the characters. She was very nervous because she had never acted before, or even thought about it. But I finally convinced her mother to let her do it. The ending result was great. We all were very happy with her performance."" Camren is now one of the breakout stars of Fox's new hit TV series ""Gotham"" as Selina Kyle.In 2014, Stokes set his eyes on entering into the world of television and is launching his new Film and Television Production Company Footage Films. Since it's inception Stokes' Production Company has produced and released a number of films over several different mediums. The most recent of which come from a three picture deal Stokes had with media giant Viacom in 2018. In 2018, Stokes directed three films. The first film was a suspense/drama titled We Belong Together which starred Draya Michele, Charles Malik Whitfield and Elise Neal. We Belong Together aired on BET in July 2018. The second film was a political drama titled Running Out Of Time which starred Tasha Smith and RonReaco Lee. Running Out Of Time aired on BET in December 1, 2018. To round out the trifecta, the third film, Fall Girls which starred Amara La Negra and Tammy Roman aired on BET in January 2019.

Waters took her under his wing in 1966 wherein she started ""acting out"" a number of his deviant creations for gross-out effect alongside other outré members that included transvestite actor Divine, Mary Vivian Pearce, David Lochary, Cookie Mueller and the not-to-be-believed grande dame Edith Massey. Calling themselves the Dreamland Players, Stole would become known as both the hysterical foil and vengeful nemesis of ""leading lady"" Divine, playing her annoying repulsive characters as pure evil incarnate. Her role in the infamous Pink Flamingos (1972) as Connie Marble, the carrot-domed villain complete with outlandish cats-eye glasses and seedy fur coat, set the tone for her subsequent gallery of grotesques, including the tantrum-throwing girl-child Taffy Davenport in Female Trouble (1974), murderous housewife-on-the-lam Peggy Gravel in Punk Story (1977), and corn-rowed hussy Sandra Sullivan in Polyester (1981), which was the first Waters film to star a legit actor -- Tab Hunter. Stole's movie time in Waters' campfests would grow less and less as his movies/parodies grew more and more mainstream, but she remained an altruistic player for Waters nevertheless, appearing in nearly every one of his films. In 1994, she did bits in his wide releases of Grasso è bello (1988), Cry Baby (1990), La signora ammazzatutti (1994), A morte Hollywood (2000), and, his most recent, A Dirty Shame (2004).She appeared in numerous tongue-in-cheek cameos for other dubious directing talents as well with tacky, tawdry titles that begged for straight-to-video release. Over the years, Stole has made the rounds on the experimental stage. She played Van Helsing in a production of ""Dracula"" and the title papal role in ""Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,"" not to mention bizarre, contemporary treatments of the Bard's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and ""A Winter's Tale."" She recently attracted some attention in the play ""Sleeping with Straight Men"" which was seen on both coasts from 2002-2004. On the sly she has written an advice column, of all things, called ""Think Mink"" for a Baltimore newspaper. Mink Stole continues to reign as a prime film outlaw, having just completed a role in Another Gay Movie (2006) playing a character named Sloppi Seconds.

nm0831471,Shirley Stoler,Shirley Stoler,,"Her homely, pudding face was Laughtonesque in style, incapable of warmth much less a smile. It was held up by an immense frame that was both intimidating and foreboding at the same time. In return, it allowed her to play a couple of the most loathsome and terrifying women ever presented onscreen.Born to Polish-Jewish immigrants on March 30, 1929, Brooklyn's Shirley Stoler made her stage debut in 1955 and gained experience as a member of New York's experimental La Mama and Living Theatre companies. She had become a key underground player by the time she earned film infamy in 1970 at age 41.Her very first portrayal on film was as real-life homicidal maniac Martha Beck in the stark, chilling, shoestring-budgeted flick I killers della luna di miele (1970). Paired up with 'Tony Lo Bianco''s slick, handsome Raymond Fernandez, the two created a brazen pair of ""Lonelyhearts"" serial killers that are still talked about in cult circles. Going this far out on a limb, Shirley would find the going rough after this and Martha Beck a hard act to follow.And then as if nothing could out-creep her above-mentioned role, she went on to play, with utmost horror, the repulsive, whip-carrying concentration camp commandant in Lina Wertmüller's WWII masterpiece Pasqualino Settebellezze (1975) [Seven Beauties]. Stoler's reviling, seductive byplay with Giancarlo Giannini's terrified inmate, whose measly life is left in her hands, remains one of the most harrowing and fascinating scenes ever filmed. For the duration of her career, however, Shirley was obliquely cast as either Eastern European housewives or hardened ""tough broad"" types (prostitutes, bartenders, bordello madams, prison matrons).Too often featured in low budgets unworthy of her talents, her minor gallery of grotesques included the prison guard in Cercasi Susan disperatamente (1985), Spike the Bartender in Frankenhooker (1990), and the pawnshop store owner in Miami Blues (1990)_ in which she chops con man Alec Baldwin's fingers off with a machete. Occasionally she was given a more humane part, such as her brief role as the grief-stricken Vietnam-war mom in the high quality Oscar winner Il cacciatore (1978), but, for the most part, it was her monstrous tendencies that paid dividends.Elsewhere, she made her Broadway debut at age 52 in a production of ""Lolita"" starring Donald Sutherland as Humbert Humbert and Blanche Baker as the nymphet, but the show closed nine days later. On TV Shirley made occasional guest appearances and was a short-lived regular on both daytime and nighttime drama while offering comedic (""Pee-wee's Playhouse"") and dramatic (""Skag"") support.

nm0831720,Andrew L. Stone,Andrew L. Stone,,"American writer-director-producer Andrew L. Stone attended the University of California and then joined the San Francisco Film Exchange. He began in Hollywood with Universal in 1918, serving his initial apprenticeship in a film laboratory. After several more years of toil in Universal's prop department he graduated to directing short films. He financed his first two-reel effort, The Elegy (1927), himself. The following year he helmed his first feature film. Stone could hardly be described as a prolific film maker until at least the late 30s when he began contributing several story lines for light entertainments, such as Magia della musica (1941) and Hi Diddle Diddle (1943). He achieved his first critical acclaim as a director for his all-black musical Stormy Weather (1943), starring the exuberant Lena Horne. The New York Times (July 22) praised Stone's 'knowing direction' and the film as 'moving smoothly' and 'being paced just right'.Stone worked under contract at Paramount (1938-41), United Artists (1943-47) and MGM (1955-62). In 1943, he set up his own production company as a means of attaining a greater measure of creative independence. Commencing with La banda dei tre stati (1950), he proceeded to turn out a brace of commercially successful minor thrillers, films noirs and action pictures. Scornful of back-projection and post-synchronisation, he shot these films in real locations (rather than at studio facilities) for added realism, moreover, using genuine infrastructure (aircraft, trains, ocean liners) in preference to props. Some of his projects were also based on actual events, gleaned by researching factual crime magazines (of which Stone received up to eight per month on subscription). Regarded as the best among Stone's thrillers are La morsa d'acciaio (1952) and Lama Alla Gola (1958).He frequently worked in tandem with his wife Virginia L. Stone who acted as musical editor and financial supervisor. Stone's career ended rather abruptly after two lavishly-produced composer biopics, Song of Norway (1970) and Il grande valzer (1972), ended up being massive commercial failures. Nonetheless, his significant contribution to the concept and mechanics of on-location shooting was recognised with a star on the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard.","July 16, 1902 in Oakland, California, USA",1902-07-16,"Oakland, California, USA","June 9, 1999 in Los Angeles, California, USA  (undisclosed)",1999-06-09,"Los Angeles, California, USA  ",undisclosed,"Virginia L.

nm0831822,David C. Stone,David C. Stone,,"David Stone, who has died aged 78, played significant roles both in radical US film-making of the 1960s and in Britain's golden age of arthouse cinemas in the 1970s. In 1974, David and his wife, Barbara, acquired the former Classic cinema, at Notting Hill Gate, west London, which they transformed and renamed the Gate. They opened their own distribution company, Cinegate, whose first acquisition was three films by the young German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder: The Merchant of Four Seasons (1971); The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972); and Fear Eats the Soul (1974). The first Fassbinder films to be shown in Britain, these brought the Gate instant critical and box-office success at its opening in September that year. The Gate often enjoyed success with films others had passed over, including La Cage Aux Folles (1978), and Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1979). Derek Jarman's Sebastiane (1976), with Latin dialogue and subtitles, had queues around the block for six weeks. They brought over the young bodybuilder star of Pumping Iron (1977), Arnold Schwarzenegger, who posed with David for the cover of Time Out, and stated, accurately, that he was going to be ""bigger than [Sylvester] Stallone"". There were occasional run-ins with the censors, notably with the Japanese film In the Realm of the Senses (1976). For this, the Gate was temporarily turned into a club, and the Stones manned the box office in case of sudden police intervention. In 1978 they opened the Gate 2 in Brunswick Square and in 1981 Gate Camden in the beautifully restored art deco Camden Odeon. Their Victorian Gothic house in Phillimore Place became a regular Saturday night at-home for international film artists, who might include Bernardo Bertolucci, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, Richard Eyre, Wallace Shawn, Robert Kramer, Agnès Varda or Anouk Aimée. David was born in Brooklyn, New York. His mother, Leah, worked as a school secretary, and kept secret, even from David, that his father, Harry, was a taxi-driver. A mathematics prodigy, David won scholarships to a series of boarding schools. By the age of 15, David was taking a pre-medical course at the University of Rochester, New York. He soon moved on to the University of Massachusetts and textile engineering, but meanwhile he had met a young literature graduate, Barbara Weintraub. Their marriage in 1957 established a lifelong and unbreachable personal and professional relationship. In 1961 Barbara visited the Spoleto festival in Italy, and resolved to remedy its neglect of cinema. Through the brothers Jonas and Adolfas Mekas, the focal figures of New American Cinema, the Stones met and befriended many young avant-garde directors and organised a programme of their films for Spoleto. These proved a revelation to the Italian film-makers, including Luchino Visconti, Michelangelo Antonioni and Pier Paolo Pasolini, who flocked to see them. David produced Adolfas Mekas's first film, Hallelujah the Hills (1963), and Jonas Mekas's record of the Living Theatre stage production of The Brig (1964), an unsparing picture of life shot surreptitiously in a US Marines jail. It took the prize for best documentary feature at the Venice festival. David's strength as producer was that no one could ever say no to him. He produced three quickly-made features by Joe Sarno, a pioneer of sexploitation films and today a cult figure for academia; and Robert Kramer's Ice (1970), a key work on radical action of the period. Later he also produced Kramer's Milestones (1975) and Scenes from the Class Struggle in Portugal (1977). A more personal undertaking was his friend Jerome Hill's autobiographical Film Portrait (1973). In 2003 this film was selected for permanent preservation by the US National Film Registry. The Stones passed from production to direction when they were invited by the Cuban film organisation ICAIC to direct a feature-length documentary, Compañeras y Compañeros (1970). David subsequently helped organise the Venceremos brigades - parties of young American enthusiasts who went on working trips to Cuba. The FBI's files on the Stones were growing. Their phones were tapped and, conscious of police surveillance, they chose to move to London in 1971. When the Gate was sold in 1986, after leases on the other cinemas had expired, David decided to fulfil his dream of becoming restaurateur, and created the Gate Diner, a novel and successful blend of American diner and French brasserie. In 1990 his career took another dramatic turn. He had maintained the 60s taste for varied narcotics and alcohol. Finally, he decided to get sober. His success inspired him with a mission to share his new liberation. The Diner was sold, and in 1995 David and Barbara moved to San Francisco, where David took a degree in counselling at the University of San Mateo, California. Once qualified, he worked voluntarily as a counsellor for San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury free clinics. In 1999 the Stones returned to London, where David continued work as a counsellor, with his own private practice. Despite increasingly frequent hospitalisation, he was still seeing his patients in March this year. He is survived by Barbara and their four children, Alexandra, Jordan, Dylan and Ethan.","December 30, 1932 in New York, USA",1932-12-30,"New York, USA","April 30, 2011 in London, England, UK",2011-04-30,"London, England, UK",,Barbara Stone  (1957? - 30 April 2011) (his death) (4 children),1,0,1,4

nm0831868,Ezra Stone,Ezra Chaim Feinstone,,"An an actor, producer, director, writer, teacher and lecturer who covered all of the important mediums in one way or another during his lifetime, Ezra Stone will still be forever known for introducing quintessential late 30s and 40s teen Henry Aldrich to both radio and the stage. Stone's pitchy, cracking voice would become a familiar sound in living rooms for well over a decade.He was born Ezra Chaim Feinstone on December 2, 1917, in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The son of Solomon Feinstone, a chemist, teacher and philanthropist, and the former Rose Meadow, Stone made his debut at age 6 in a play entitled ""Phosphorus and Suppressed Desires"" for the YMHA players in Philadelphia. He later went on to tour with the National Junior Theatre of Washington, DC, in 1931-1932 before graduating from the Oak Lane Country Day School of Temple University in 1934.Stone studied for the stage at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and made his New York debut playing seven roles in the musical revue ""Parade"" in 1935. Although the ebullient teen built up his young marquee name with such popular comedies as ""Room Service,"" ""Three Men on a Horse"" and ""Brother Rat,"" he found his pot of gold winning the stage role of Henry Aldrich in ""What a Life"" in 1938. More riches came his way on Broadway with the role of Dromio in ""The Boys from Syracuse"" and as Arthur Lee in ""See My Lawyer.""Twenty years old at the time he started playing the teenage Henry on radio, Stone enjoyed a healthy 13 years (1939-1953) as the disaster-prone youth who was summoned into millions of homes to the eternal lament of his long-suffering mother: ""Hen-reeee! Henry Aldrich!"" -- which was invariably followed by Henry's anguished reply: ""Coming Mother!"" By 1941 ""The Aldrich Family"" was rated among the ""top ten"" programs alongside Jack Benny and Bob Hope's popular shows.As for films, Stone never got it into gear. He can only be witnessed in a support role in the ""B"" movie Those Were the Days! (1940) as Allie Bang. He also played a cameo as himself, Sgt. Ezra Stone, in This Is the Army (1943), the feature film version of the hit Broadway play he appeared in the year before.WWII intervened in 1942 but Stone managed to incorporate his life's passion into his military duties by directing and appearing in a number of US Army Special Services productions. On October 5, 1942, Ezra married actress/director/teacher Sara Seegar. They went on to have two children, Josef and Francine.Following the war Stone focused on writing and directing. During TV's ""Golden Age"" he not only wrote sketches for the sitcom The Aldrich Family (1949), which ran for four seasons, but also for shows that starred some of TV's funniest: Danny Thomas, Milton Berle, Fred Allen and Martha Raye. At around the same time he directed a number of Broadway productions including ""Me and Molly,"" the farcical ""At War with the Army,"" which also featured wife Sara, and ""Wake Up, Darling."" In the 1960s Stone started directed TV sitcoms and adventures, making the rounds on such sets as Petticoat Junction (1963), I mostri (1964), Lost in Space (1965) and The Flying Nun (1967).Ezra and Sara were married for 48 years until her death in 1990. Four years later, the icon of ""old-time"" radio was fatally injured in a one-vehicle road accident in New Jersey at age 76.","December 2, 1917 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, USA",1917-12-02,"New Bedford, Massachusetts, USA","March 3, 1994 in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, USA  (road accident)",1994-03-03,"Perth Amboy, New Jersey, USA  ",road accident,Sara Seegar  (5 October 1942 - 12 August 1990) (her death) (2 children),1,0,1,2
nm0831872,Fred Stone,Fred Andrew Stone,173,"Hardly remembered today, if at all, Fred Stone was once one of the most multi-faceted circus performers to hit turn-of-the century America. There seemed to be nothing he couldn't do--tightrope walking, acrobatics, clowning . . . you name it. This initial celebrity eventually led to his stellar headlining in vaudeville houses, stardom on the Broadway musical stage and character lead work in films.He was born in a Valmont, Colorado, log cabin in the summer of 1873. Running away from home at the ripe old age of 11, he eventually joined a traveling circus show. By his teens he had taught himself the high-wire act and other athletic skills so well that he earned a name for himself under the big top. He met and teamed up with fellow circus performer David Craig Montgomery (1870-1917) in 1895. Billed as ""Montgomery and Stone,"" they became a prominent song-and-dance duo in burlesque houses and minstrel shows. The toast of New York in the first decade of the 1900s, they appeared in a number of hit revues, including ""The Red Mill"" and ""Chin Chin."" One of their most famous pairings was in the 1903 Broadway musical version of L. Frank Baum's ""The Wizard of Oz"" in which Fred portrayed the Scarecrow to Montgomery's Tin Man. The agile duo also shared billing on various other circuits, including ""Wild West"" shows, with the likes of close friends Will Rogers and Annie Oakley.After Montgomery's unexpected death on April 20, 1917, following an unsuccessful operation, Fred continued solo, often appearing with wife Allene Crater (later billed as Allene Stone or Mrs. Fred Stone) in such musical shows as ""Criss Cross"" and ""Ripples."" Fred also extended his talents to the movies. Although he didn't become a steady fixture (he dropped out of films by the early 1920s), he had wrangled a few of his own comedy and western vehicles to make a dent, with The Goat (1918), Under the Top (1919), Johnny Get Your Gun (1919), The Duke of Chimney Butte (1921) and Billy Jim (1922) being his best. He made an auspicious return to the movies in the sound era as Katharine Hepburn's beleaguered father in the seriocomic classic Primo amore (1935), and as a feuding clan member in the tumbleweed western Il sentiero del pino solitario (1936). Given such a rousing reception, the 63-year-old was offered his own secondary feature, top-lining such comedy efforts as Sogni dorati (1936), Grand Jury (1936), Quick Money (1937) and No Place to Go (1939), before ending his lucky streak with L'uomo del West (1940) starring Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan. In 1950 Fred retired completely from show business. During the final years of his life he suffered from advancing blindness and heart trouble. He died at his Los Angeles home in March of 1959 at age 85. The patriarch of a show-biz family, his daughters Dorothy Stone, Paula Stone and Carol Stone were also actresses who appeared with their father at various times on Broadway (he was also the uncle of Milburn Stone, veteran character actor and Gunsmoke (1955)'s ""Doc Adams""). A long-overdue biography of Fred Stone was published by Armond Fields in 2002.","August 19, 1873 in Longmont, Colorado, USA",1873-08-19,"Longmont, Colorado, USA","March 6, 1959 in North Hollywood, California, USA  (undisclosed)",1959-03-06,"North Hollywood, California, USA  ",undisclosed,Allene Crater (actress)  (1904 - 13 August 1957) (her death) (3 children),1,0,1,3
nm0831889,George E. Stone,Gerschon Lichtenstein,161,"A minor prototype of the ""Runyon-esque"" character for more than three decades, Polish-born actor George E. Stone (né Gerschon Lichtenstein, on May 18, 1903) was, in actuality, a close friend of writer Damon Runyan and would play scores of colorful ""dees, dem and dos"" cronies throughout the 1920s, '30s, and '40s. With great names such as Johnnie the Shiek, Boots Burnett, Ice Box Hamilton, Wires Kagel, Ropes McGonigle, Society Max, and Toothpick Charlie, Stone delighted audiences in scores of crimers for decades.A vaudeville and Broadway hoofer in the interim, the runt-sized Stone (5'3"") finally scored in his first ""grownup"" part as the Sewer Rat in the silent drama Settimo cielo (1927) starring the once-popular romantic pair Charles Farrell and (Academy Award winner) Janet Gaynor. As ""Georgie"" sounded too child-like, he began billing himself as ""George E. Stone."" From there he was featured in a number of ""tough guy"" potboilers, particularly for Warner Bros. So typed was he as a henchman or thug, that he found few films outside the genre. His gunsels often possessed a yellow streak and could be both broadly comic or threatening in nature, with more than a few of them ending up on a morgue slab before film's end, including his Earl Williams on The Front Page (1931) and Otero in the classic gangster flick Piccolo Cesare (1931).Included in George's many films were a number of Oscar-quality pictures , including The Racket (1928), I pionieri del West (1931), Five Star Final (1931), 42a strada (1933), Viva Villa! (1934), Avorio nero (1936), Giubbe rosse (1940), Mano pericolosa (1953), La tunica (1953), La lancia che uccide (1954), L'uomo dal braccio d'oro (1955), Bulli e pupe (1955), Qualcuno verrà (1958), A qualcuno piace caldo (1959), Angeli con la pistola (1961). Arguably, Stone's most popular, if not prolific, role was when he replaced Charles Wagenheim as The Runt in the second of the ""Boston Blackie"" film series, Confessions of Boston Blackie (1941) that starred Chester Morris as the title detective. The series lasted eight years.Suffering from failing eyesight in later years, George was virtually blind by the late 1950s but, thanks to friends, managed to secure sporadic film and TV work. From 1958 on, Stone could be glimpsed in a recurring role on the popular courtroom series Perry Mason (1957) as a court clerk.

nm0831905,Harold J. Stone,Harold Jacob Hochstein,178,"Never a big name but always a reliable staple on TV crime shows during the 1960s and 1970s, Harold J. Stone usually was seen in a strong, unsympathetic vein -- an unyielding father or husband, corrupt businessman, menacing crime figure, etc. A sober-looking gent with a block jaw, Romanesque-styled nose and steely gray-black hair, he was also prone to playing ethnic types of varying origins.Born Harold Jacob Hochstein in New York City on March 3, 1913, the scion of a Jewish acting family who established themselves in the Yiddish theater, Stone started on stage with his father as a child. He once entertained a career in medicine, attaining a BA degree at the University of Buffalo Medical School, but acting proved too strong a desire. After initially finding work in radio, Stone made his Broadway bow with ""The World We Make"" (1939), which led to other productions such as ""Morning Star"" (1940) and ""A Bell for Adano"" (1944). His early work in New York on stage and TV eventually paved the way to a modest character career in movies and a move to Hollywood.In the 1950s Stone began to provide a minor, shady presence in such ""A"" films as Humphrey Bogart's Il colosso d'argilla (1956), Alfred Hitchcock's Il ladro (1956), the Rocky Graziano biopic Lassù qualcuno mi ama (1956), the ultimate gladiator spectacle Spartacus (1960) and the gangster epic Il massacro del giorno di San Valentino (1967) in which he played Chicago mobster Frank Nitti. He also played a no-nonsense foil to good friend Jerry Lewis in a few of his wacky 60s comedies. None of these, however, did much to improve his standing. Television, on the other hand, became a strong and steady medium for Stone, and he became a fixture in hundreds of police dramas including Indirizzo permanente (1958), La città in controluce (1958), Gli intoccabili (1959), Mannix (1967), Missione impossibile (1966), Agenzia Rockford (1974) and Il tenente Kojak (1973). He was once Emmy-nominated for a dramatic guest role.Left a widower by his first wife Joan in 1960, by whom he had two children, he continued to work primarily on episodic TV into the mid-1980s before retiring and settling down with his second wife Miriam (from 1962), who bore him another child.

He enlisted to fight in the Spanish American War and when he returned, he returned to be a writer. This turned to acting and he began to appear in films during the middle teens. His career was again interrupted by war as he served in the cavalry during World War I. After the war, he returned to films and quickly graduated to lead roles. With his distinguished look and grey hair, he was able to play the roles of well mannered romantic men. In 1921, Lewis starred in Don't Neglect Your Wife (1921). In the next year, he starred with Alice Terry, who played the heroine, and Ramon Novarro in The Prisoner of Zenda (1922) and Scaramouche (1923). In 1924, Metro merged into the new MGM where Lewis remained for the rest of his career. He was busy over the next few years and garnered an Academy Award nomination for Lo zar folle (1928). In 1928, he appeared in the first of a series of pictures with Greta Garbo. In Il destino (1928) he played the older doctor, a friend of the family. But two years later in Romanzo (1930), he played her lover.Lewis made the transition from silent to sound with The Trial of Mary Dugan (1929), which starred Norma Shearer. Sound did not cause Lewis any problems and he continued to be busy with his roles as the distinguished lead. Carcere (1930) was highly successful for MGM and he appeared in other popular movies such as Il fantasma di Parigi (1931) with John Gilbert and Red-Headed Woman (1932) with Jean Harlow. He appeared with Garbo in La modella (1931), Mata Hari (1931), Grand Hotel (1932) and La regina Cristina (1933). In the late 30s he took on a role for which he was long remembered - the role of Judge James Hardy who had a son named Andy. Judge Hardy was the father audiences wanted in the late 30s early 40s. He was kind, intellectual, fair and as patient as he had to be with Andy, played by Mickey Rooney. This series occupied most of his screen time until it ended and he did slow down during the late 40s. In the 50s he continued to appear in a number of pictures including remakes of the two he had made 30 years before with Alice Terry. He suffered a heart attack and died in 1953 after appearing in over 200 films.","November 15, 1879 in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA",1879-11-15,"Worcester, Massachusetts, USA","September 12, 1953 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA  (heart attack)",1953-09-12,"Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA  ",heart attack,"Wolf, Hazel Elizabeth  (19 October 1930 - 12 September 1953) (his death)

Acting must have been in his blood as the nephew of Broadway comedian Fred Stone for Milburn left home as a teenager to find work with touring repertory troupes. Emulating his famous uncle Fred, he appeared in vaudeville as part of a song-and-dance team called ""Stone and Strain."" Following a minor appearance on Broadway in ""The Jayhawkers,"" Milburn moved to Los Angeles in 1935 to try his luck in films. He toiled for years in mostly unbilled parts for 'poverty row' Monogram Pictures, apprenticing in a number of background roles as both benign fellows (clerks, reporters, sailors, detectives) and bad guys (convicts, robbers, henchmen). Out of the blue he would nab a heroic film lead in films as Federal Bullets (1937) or serial thrillers as The Great Alaskan Mystery (1944) and The Master Key (1945), then invariably go right back to unbilled status in his very next role. One memorable featured part (which was also unbilled) was as debater Stephen A. Douglass in John Ford's Alba di gloria (1939). In addition he played a regular support role in the ""Tommy Tailspin"" serials and found himself cast in a few of Ford's pictures. When the role of ""Doc Adams"" finally landed at his feet in 1955, the exasperated actor was only too appreciative to experience a steady paycheck. He became an ""overnight"" star and, along with Matt Dillon's James Arness, stayed a citizen of Dodge City throughout its entire 20-year run (500 episodes), although he was temporarily sidelined by a heart attack in 1971 and briefly replaced by another ""doc"" played by Pat Hingle. The ever-durable Stone missed only seven episodes. After his return, however, his appearances were somewhat curtailed. Milburn won a well-deserved Emmy award in 1968 for his crusty role. Fully retired to his ranch in 1975 after the show's cancellation, he was eventually awarded an honorary doctorate from St. Mary of the Plains College in (of course) Dodge City, Kansas. Married to Jane Garrison, the 75-year-old Milburn died of a heart attack on June 12, 1980 in La Jolla, California.

nm0832415,Larry Storch,Larry Storch,173,"As a kid in the 1930s growing up in a tough New York neighborhood, kinetic wiseguy Larry Storch took in the multi-ethnic flavor of his surroundings and started blurting out various accents as a juvenile to provoke laughs and earn attention. Little did he know that this early talent would take him on a six-decade journey as a prime actor and comedian. Larry's gift as an impressionist paid off early as a teen in vaudeville houses. Following military duty during WWII as a seaman (1942-1946), a happenstance meeting with comedian Phil Harris in Palm Springs led to an opening act gig at Ciro's for Lucille Ball's and Desi Arnaz' show. From there he received his biggest break yet on radio with ""The Kraft Music Hall"" when he was asked to sub for an ailing Frank Morgan. Larry not only delivered his patented star impersonations, he did a devastating one of Morgan himself that went over famously.A summer hosting replacement on the TV variety show Cavalcade of Stars (1949) was followed by Larry's own variety series, The Larry Storch Show (1953). In musical revues from the early 1950s with such showcases as ""Red, Hot and Blue"" and ""Curtain Going Up,"" he also became a fixture on the nightclub circuit. He made a leap into legit acting with the musical ""You Never Know"" (1955) and comedies ""The Tender Trap"" (1956) and ""Who Was that Lady I Saw You With?"" (1958), in which he played a hyper Russian spy. In the meantime, a long-lasting friendship with Tony Curtis that formulated during his Navy days paid off in spades. Curtis started finding work for his buddy in his films, beginning with an unbilled bit in the Universal costumer Il principe ladro (1951). When Larry's career was going through a noticeable lull in the early 1960s, Curtis again came to the rescue by giving him top supporting roles in some of his prime cinematic fluff--Chi era quella signora? (1960) (in which he recreated his stage role), 20 chili di guai!... e una tonnellata di gioia (1962), Donne v'insegno come si seduce un uomo (1964) and Monsieur Cognac (1964).TV audiences soon started seeing his manic-looking mug regularly on episodic TV, including The Phil Silvers Show (1955) and Car 54, Where Are You? (1961). Larry's biggest claim to fame would come via his role as Forrest Tucker's loyal but not particularly bright sidekick Cpl. Randolph Agarn in the western comedy I forti di Forte Coraggio (1965). While continuing to make an ""impression"" in nightclubs, Larry found a lucrative outlet in animation, too, giving vocal life to four decades' worth of cartoons, including the series Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales (1963), Ughetto cane perfetto (1964), The Pink Panther Show (1969) and Scooby-Doo, dove sei tu? (1969). He also provided the voice of Koko the Clown in the syndicated cartoon show Out of the Inkwell (1961).Beginning in the 1980s Storch made a comic resurgence of sorts under the theater lights with a healthy run opposite Jean Stapleton and Marion Ross in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" from 1986-1988, and in the musicals ""Oklahoma!"" (1990) and ""Annie Get Your Gun"" (2000), the latter as Chief Sitting Bull. He also appeared with his friend Curtis again, this time in a musical stage version of Curtis' classic film A qualcuno piace caldo (1959). Larry was married to actress Norma Storch from 1961 until her death from cancer in 2003.","January 8, 1923 in New York City, New York, USA",1923-01-08,"New York City, New York, USA",,,,,Norma Storch  (10 July 1961 - 28 August 2003) (her death),1,0,0,0

nm0832475,June Storey,Mary June Storey,,"If the purpose of a ""prairie flower"" was to help distract the cowboy hero from the bad guys and/or his horse, then lovely ""B"" blonde actress June Storey fit the bill. She certainly inspired guitar-strumming balladeer Gene Autry to warble a few ditties in ten of his popular Republic Pictures' oaters.The Toronto-born leading lady moved with her parents and sister at age 5 to the United States, first to Connecticut then to Long Island, New York, then to Southern California. Following graduation from Laguna Beach High School, she turned to the local stage (including the Laguna Playhouse) and, through family connections, won a screen test at 20th Century-Fox that earned her a contract. A wholesome, natural beauty and one-time model, she apprenticed in starlet bits including work in Student Tour (1934), Collegio femminile (1936), skater Sonja Henie's vehicle Scandalo al grand hotel (1937) and the fictionalized retelling of the great Chicago fire of 1871 L'incendio di Chicago (1938). She did not progress in the ranks, however, and was left pretty much high and dry.In 1939 Republic signed June up and this is where she began her association with Autry, appearing, beginning with Blue Montana Skies (1939), in ten of his westerns within a two-year span. Feeling trapped and uninspired in this setting she left Republic to find a bigger studio but didn't and freelanced for the remainder of her career. Making the effort to branch out into other film genres with the mystery whodunnit The Lone Wolf Takes a Chance (1941) and the noirish End of the Road (1944), she couldn't rise above the second tier in films. Her last leading role was in the Western Song of the Prairie (1945) starring Ken Curtis. She added some radio work (""Ellery Queen"") and toured Army camps following this period and after a few supporting/small roles in some obscure films, June retired from the movies after marrying an Oregon rancher. She never returned.She devoted much of her later life to charitable causes and became a nurse for a time. Her long association with Autry also allowed her to be a frequent guest at western film festivals and Autry tributes. She later sought a spiritual guidance and became a deacon at her Presbyterian Church in Southern California before dying of cancer on December 18, 1991 at age 73.

nm0832561,Gale Storm,Josephine Owaissa Cottle,,"The youngest of five children, and born with the drab, unlikely name of Josephine Cottle on April 5, 1922, this pleasantly appealing, Texas-born, auburn-haired beauty was only seventeen months old when her father, William, passed away. The family moved from Bloomington (her home town) to McDade (between Austin and Houston), where her mother, Minnie, made ends meet as a seamstress and milliner. The family eventually settled in Houston, where Gale took dance and ice skating lessons, developed a strong interest in acting, and performed in high school dramatics. Encouraged by her teachers, Gale by chance entered and was chosen the winner of a local radio talent contest called Jesse L. Lasky's ""Gateway to Hollywood"" in 1939. This took her and her mother to Hollywood, where she captured the national contest title.Handed the more exciting stage moniker of ""Gale Storm"", she was soon put under contract to RKO Pictures. Although she was dropped by the studio after only six months, she had established herself enough to find work elsewhere, including at Monogram and Universal. Appearing in a number of ""B"" musicals, mysteries and westerns, her wholesome, open-faced prettiness made her a natural for filming. The programmers, however, that she co-starred in were hardly the talk of the town. Making her inauspicious debut with Non sono una spia (1940), her '40s movies bore such dubious titles as Let's Go Collegiate (1941), Freckles Comes Home (1942), Revenge of the Zombies (1943), Sunbonnet Sue (1945), Swing Parade 1946 (1946), and Colpo di scena a Cactus Creek (1950), indicating the difficulty of finding material worthy of her talent. Arguably, her better movies include the family Christmas tale Accadde nella quinta strada (1947), which co-starred Don DeFore; the overlooked western comedy Daniele tra i pellirosse (1948) opposite Eddie Albert; and the film noir piece Delitto in prima pagina (1950) with Dan Duryea.After years of toiling in films, Gale finally turned things around at age 30 by transplanting herself to the small screen. Her very first TV series, My Little Margie (1952), which was only supposed to be a summer replacement series for Lucy ed io (1951), became one of the most watched sitcoms in the early '50s while showing up in syndicated reruns for decades. Co-starring the popular film star Charles Farrell as her amiable dad, Gale's warmth and ingratiating style suited TV to a tee, making her one of the most popular light comediennes of the time. She segued directly into her second hit series as a cruise ship director in The Gale Storm Show: Oh! Susanna (1956), which was better known as ""Oh! Susannah"" after it went into syndication. Co-starring woebegone Zasu Pitts as the ship's manicurist and her ""Ethel Mertz"" counterpart, this show lasted a season longer than her first.In the midst of all this, the (gasp!) thirty-something star dared to launch her own Las Vegas nightclub and pop recording careers. Always looking much younger than she was, she produced a number of Billboard chart makers, including ""I Hear You Knocking"" (her first hit), ""Memories Are Made of This"", ""Ivory Tower"" and her own cover of ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"". Her most successful song of the decade was ""Dark Moon"", which peaked at #4.Gale's film career took a sharp decline following the demise of her second series in 1960. Most of her focus was placed modestly on the summer stock or dinner theater circuit, doing a revolving door of tailor-made comedies and musicals such as ""Cactus Flower"", ""Forty Carats"", ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" and ""South Pacific"". She finally appeared again on TV in a Love Boat (1977) segment in 1979 after nearly a two-decade absence. It was later revealed in Gale's candid autobiography ""I Ain't Down Yet"" (1981) and on the talk show circuit that the disappearance was triggered by a particularly vicious battle with alcohol.

Storm holds belts in Arashi-Ryu Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Ninjitsu, Jujitsu and Northern Shaolin Kung Fu.If you ask three time ""Martial Art Masters Hall of Fame"" inductee Storm how his action career started, you might not expect to hear that his Mother forced 8 year old Storm to take Karate because he was ""hyperactive and clumsy"". However, hardly anything about Storm is as it appears. Storm was born ""Juan Ricardo Ojeda"" to an African-American Father and Puerto Rican Mother and was then adopted by a Native American-Caucasian mother and Mexican-American father. Storm was brought up in the Asian/Polynesian culture of Honolulu, Hawaii. Storm truly is an ""All American"" - melting pot meets cultural mosaic - one that always had to check the box marked ""other."" In high school Storm was shy and started break-dancing as a way of trying to ""fit in"". This quickly became his passion and eventually led to Storm winning over 200 dance competitions in the genres of hip hop and break-dance. Storm received a dance scholarship, which paved the way for him moving to LA and dancing in music videos.Although dancing was his passion, it only provided him with enough money for rent and a diet of ramen noodles and pop tarts with little left for anything else. Being devoted to the martial arts, Storm found himself stopping by and observing an outdoor Northern Shaolin class on his way home from work. Eventually Storm was approached by the teacher and asked to join, thus allowing him to broaden his knowledge of the martial arts. Wanting to further pursue his creative energies Storm began acting. He then graduated from the Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown Acting Academy. While playing the role of Bayu on the television series, Conan The Adventurer, Storm developed the unique style that he is known for. This brand of action is a combination of martial arts, acrobatic skill, comedic timing, and an almost balletic grace. Storm has since gone on to work with Jet Li, Samo Hung, Sir Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Kelly Hu, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Michelle Rodriquez, Neal McDonough and Kristanna Loken.","February 14, 1968 in Indiana, USA",1968-02-14,"Indiana, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

Now retired from his government job, George has more time to enjoy his off-beat movie roles, which allow him to release his well-honed sardonic sense of humor.","July 3, 1946 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA",1946-07-03,"Baltimore, Maryland, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

The daughter of a grocer, Strabel was born in Crown Point, Indiana, though she at times claimed her mother's birthplace of Pennsylvania as her own. She grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois and sold her first story at 10 to a Pittsburgh newspaper. After college, she worked as a fashion reporter and a fashion advertising copywriter before taking up fiction writing during an extended illness. Her first novel, ""Smart Woman,"" was published in 1933. She sold a story, ""You Can't Escape Forever,"" to Warner Bros. in 1938, but it is unclear whether it was ever filmed, and a later film of that title credits a different author. Her first, and greatest, success with a film adaptation of her work was Cecil B. DeMille's Vento selvaggio (1942), from her bestseller. That was followed the same year by Presi tra le fiamme (1942), adapted from her magazine story ""The Forest Ranger."" Concurrent with that tale, she met and married David P. Godwin, the chief of fire control for the U.S. Forest Service. Godwin died in a 1947 plane crash, soon after Strabel's last film adaptation was released, Tragico segreto (1946), based on her magazine story ""You Were There.""

nm0833117,Rose Stradner,Rosa Stradner,,"Pretty, soulful-eyed Austrian actress Rose Stradner was a rising 30s ingénue on the Viennese stage and in a few German film romances and musicals when MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer, who was in Europe searching for exotic talent, discovered Rose. Along with Greer Garson, Ilona Massey and Hedy Lamarr, she was brought to Hollywood and groomed as a foreign import. Unfortunately, her personal life became a shambles and eventually overwhelmed her ability to perform.She was born Rosa Stradner in Vienna in 1913 and educated at a convent. Her desire to become an actress came young. At 16 she studied at the Academy for Music and Art in Zurich, Switzerland, and at the age of 19, she auditioned for Max Reinhardt and handed a contract. She appeared for Reinhardt at the Voks and Josefstadt Theaters, often in the classics (Shakespeare, Ibsen, Moliere) but handled modern pieces (Dreiser, O'Neill) just as well. In Europe she also appeared in some films between 1933 and 1936.Fleeing Austria during the Nazi invasion, Rose, her then-husband Karl Heinz Martin, a stage director, and her mother arrived in the States in 1936. She and her husband divorced soon after however. Making her U.S. debut as Edward G. Robinson's put-upon wife in L'ultimo gangster (1937), she showed promise and was signed by MGM. Her second film Blind Alley (1939), which was more Freudian in nature, starred Chester Morris as a psychologically-disturbed mobster who abducts psychiatrist Ralph Bellamy. Rose had less to do in this picture.The budding star met well-known writer/producer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz at around this time and she placed her career on hold. The couple married in 1939 had two sons, Chris and Tom. Christopher Mankiewicz, who was born a year later, went on to become a modest film producer in the 1980s. Although Rose returned for a small but key role as a Mother Superior in her husband's film Le chiavi del paradiso (1944), her career was officially over after only three films. In 1948 she was cast in the Edna Ferber play ""Bravo!"" but she had to be replaced during tryouts which caused her severe mental strain.On a positive note, her fluency in several languages helped her husband's screenplays but the marriage was rocky almost from the start. In addition to Mankiewcz' infamous affairs with such stars as Judy Garland and Linda Darnell, Rose did not take to being strictly a ""hausfrau"" easily and soon turned destructive with alcohol used to deaden her unhappiness. She would be known for going into emotional tirades and eventually she was admitted into clinics for her violent rages and psychological disturbances. Constantly threatening suicide, a lethal mix of bitterness and depression set in and on September 27, 1958 ended her pain with an overdose of sleeping pills in her Mt. Kisco, New York, residence. She was only 45.","July 31, 1913 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary [now Austria]",1913-07-31,"Vienna, Austria-Hungary [now Austria]","September 27, 1958 in Mount Kisco, New York, USA  (suicide by overdose)",1958-09-27,"Mount Kisco, New York, USA  ",suicide by overdose,"Joseph L.

nm0833152,Beatrice Straight,Beatrice Whitney Straight,170,"In her long career, Beatrice Straight actually did very little work in the movies, plying her trade mostly onstage. But when she did grace the silver screen, she did it with great skill. Her first love was theater, having debuted on Broadway in the 1935 ""Bitter Oleander"". Her work garnered her much acclaim, including laurels in her Tony-winning performance for which she won the award for best supporting actress as Elizabeth Proctor in the 1953 production of Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible"". In addition to theater and movies, she gave us notable work on television. In 1978, she won an Emmy nomination for her part as the matriarch Alice Dain Leggett in the miniseries Il bacio della violenza (1978). No less stately, she played the part of Lynda Carter's Queen Mother in the 1970s Wonder Woman (1975) series. Her life was touched by that same kind of elegance and stateliness that she often portrayed onstage and on-screen. She was born Beatrice Whitney Straight in Old Westbury on Long Island. Her father, banker and diplomat Willard Dickerman Straight, associated with the likes of J.P. Morgan. Her mother, Dorothy Payne Whitney Straight, was an heiress of the Whitneys, a dynastic (in the sense of TV's own ""Dynasty""), moneyed family on the eastern seaboard. Beatrice went to the best schools and caught the acting bug while a student in Devonshire, England, rendering a critically acclaimed performance in a school production of Ibsen's ""A Doll's House."" Her studies subsequently turned to acting, and she studied under the tutelage of Michael Chekhov, nephew of Russian playwright Anton Chekhov and a member of the Moscow Art Theatre. Their relationship was somewhat symbiotic in that she persuaded him to start an acting school, later teaching there herself. It was through her work in the theater that she met her husband Peter Cookson, appearing opposite him as leading lady in ""The Heiress"" in 1948. She is perhaps best known for her achievement in the 1976 movie Quinto potere (1976); after only three days of work in that movie in just a few scenes that actually made it into the final cut, Beatrice Straight contributed such a stellar performance that she earned the Academy Award for the best performance by a supporting actress.","August 2, 1914 in Old Westbury, New York, USA",1914-08-02,"Old Westbury, New York, USA","April 7, 2001 in Los Angeles, California, USA  (pneumonia)",2001-04-07,"Los Angeles, California, USA  ",pneumonia,"Peter Cookson  (2 June 1949 - 6 January 1990) (his death) (2 children)

He taught himself (by ear) the fiddle and guitar at a young age and started performing at local functions as a teen. In the late 1920s, Glenn and his cousin, Taylor McPeters, better known later as the western character actor Cactus Mack, joined a radio singing group known as the ""Arizona Wranglers"" that toured throughout the country.They both started providing singing fillers in film westerns in the early 1930s. Glenn would play extra or bit roles for a number of years B Western and serials. One of his first roles was uncredited as a soldier, in tin armor, as part of ""Ming's Army"", in the science fiction classic serial ""Flash Gordon""(1936/I). He would perform as a cowhand, rustler, accomplice, sidekick, or plain old warbling, harmonica-blowing cowboy. Eventually in the late 30s, his billing improved and he evolved into a full-time bad guy in hundreds of ""B"" westerns. He was seen (or glimpsed) in many of the popular serials of the day, including Uragano express (1932), Law of the Wild (1934),The Lone Ranger Rides Again (1939), and Riders of Death Valley (1941). It was his massive build that helped him break into the Universal horror picture genre of the 1940s. Horror star Boris Karloff had grown weary and fearful of his Frankenstein Creature typecast and abandoned the role. Glenn was the perfect replacement for the job and made his monstrous debut with Al di là del mistero (1944), quickly followed by La casa degli orrori (1945). It was he who played the Creature in the cult horror/comedy classic Il cervello di Frankenstein (1948) as part of the monstrous trio of Bela Lugosi's Dracula and Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man.As the ""B"" western started faded off into the sunset in the 1950s, Strange moseyed on over to TV work. He played the nemesis ""Butch Cavendish"" and later reprised the role, after a prison escape, on ""The Lone Ranger"" (1949). Among other TV roles, he capped off his career with a steady (12 years) role as Sam the bartender on the classic Gunsmoke (1955) series from 1962 until shortly before his death from lung cancer in 1973.","August 16, 1899 in Weed, New Mexico, USA",1899-08-16,"Weed, New Mexico, USA","September 20, 1973 in Los Angeles, California, USA  (lung cancer)",1973-09-20,"Los Angeles, California, USA  ",lung cancer,"Minnie Thompson Strange  (1937 - 20 September 1973) (his death) (1 child)

Raised in Passaic, New Jersey, she grew into a striking young teen and worked for a time as a model in a local children's department store. Trekking back to New York City equipped only with her modeling credentials and a natural singing talent, Marcia found herself performing in an off-Broadway show at the ripe old age of 15, replacing 17-year-old Liza Minnelli in the musical ""Best Foot Forward."" Inspired, Marcia ventured ahead with a number of stage roles, then broke into television and scored her first semi-regular role as an army nurse on the very first season of MASH (1972). Her big breakout role, and the one for which she will best be remembered, was as Gabe Kaplan's wife on the popular sitcom I ragazzi del sabato sera (1975) for four seasons. Despite the steady work, she was fairly disillusioned at playing the relatively sane (i.e., overlooked) role of Julie Kotter. Most of the focus landed squarely on her husband, a Brooklyn schoolteacher (the show was based on Kaplan's real-life experiences as a teacher) and his interaction with student ""Sweathogs"" Robert Hegyes, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, Ron Palillo and pre-megastar John Travolta. Stuck with essentially a reactive character, she gamely stayed with the show throughout its run. ""Kotter"" would be her only hit series despite a handful of attempts, but she managed to persevere in later years with guest spots on such shows as Magnum P.I. (1980), Storie incredibili (1985), Highlander (1992), Per amore della legge (1994) and Providence (1999). She would regain major attention one more time as (again) a wholesome wife, playing nerdy Rick Moranis' spouse in the surprise Disney hit Tesoro, mi si sono ristretti i ragazzi (1989). She reprised that role in the equally popular sequel, Tesoro, mi si è allargato il ragazzino (1992). In 1998 Marcia returned to her musical roots and performed with ""Beauty and the Beast"" star Susan Egan in ""Hello Again,"" which was a revamped version of the Max Ophüls classic French film La ronde: Il piacere e l'amore (1950). Here she played against type as a prostitute. Over the years Marcia has carved out a niche for herself not only as a fine actress but also as a social and labor activist, and has lent her skills and talents to many progressive causes.","April 28, 1948 in New York City, New York, USA",1948-04-28,"New York City, New York, USA","October 24, 2014 in Sherman Oaks, California, USA  (breast cancer)",2014-10-24,"Sherman Oaks, California, USA  ",breast cancer,Robert Collector  (22 September 1984 - 1989) (divorced) (1 child),1,1,1,1

She was born Dorothy Ruth Hoogstraten on February 28, 1960 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She grew up in a rough neighborhood in Vancouver, but kept out of trouble and went through the motions of school. While not a beauty as a child, nor early teen, Stratten came into her own out of high school and attracted the attention of Paul Snider, a promoter and wannabe star. He started dating her and after seeing an advertisement for Playboy's 25th Anniversary Playmate search in 1978, convinced her to pose for photos. Playboy saw the potential in Stratten and flew her out to Los Angeles, California, where she became a candidate. Although she lost out to Candy Loving, Stratten was made a Playmate in the August 1979 issue of Playboy. Soon after, she was pressured into marrying Snider, who had a Svengali-like influence on her.After her centerfold came out, Stratten found work in a few movies, notably Americathon (1979) and Skatetown, U.S.A. (1979), as well as being the object of Richard Dawson's affection in an ABC-TV special shot at the Playboy mansion. Clearly, her star was on the rise. In 1980, it was revealed that Stratten would be tabbed as the Playmate of the Year by Playboy publisher and founder Hugh Hefner. While this was one of the crowning achievements of her career, things were not going well in her marriage to Snider. He bothered her on the set of the movie Galaxina (1980) and when Snider found out she was developing more than a friendly relationship with director Peter Bogdanovich, Snider grew increasingly frustrated.After a separation, Snider bought a shotgun and talked Stratten into coming to the apartment they used to share in West Los Angeles. Snider tied her up, sexually assaulted her and put the shotgun next to her face and pulled the trigger. Snider then turned the shotgun on himself to complete the murder-suicide. Since her death, Stratten has become something of a minor cult fixture, and has had two (one a television) movies, a song, and a couple of books written about her. The last movie she was in, ...e tutti risero (1981), was released after her death.","February 28, 1960 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",1960-02-28,"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","August 14, 1980 in West Los Angeles, California, USA  (homicide)",1980-08-14,"West Los Angeles, California, USA  ",homicide,Paul Snider  (1 June 1979 - 14 August 1980) (her death),1,0,0,0

More films roles soon followed, usually playing himself in such movies as Dangerous Years (1947) and Half Past Midnight (1948). In Stalag 17 (1953) he made a noteworthy impression as ""Cookie"", the stuttering narrator. His small physical stature landed him the part of ""Mousie"", a smaller member of Marlon Brando's motorcycle gang in Il selvaggio (1953).He next played ""Junior Jackson"" in the 1954 sitcom That's My Boy (1954), which got the attention of management at the local Los Angeles CBS affiliate KNXT, and they offered him regular work as the daily sportscaster. That job wound up lasting more that 20 years and garnered him the reputation as one of the best sportscasters in the business.Being in Los Angeles also afforded Stratton the opportunity to continue work in films, often playing himself as an announcer, most notably in Mae West's last film, Sextette (1977).

Stretch was an excellent amateur as a youngster and turned professional in 1985. He won the British light-middleweight championship in September 1988, then went on to win the WBC international super welterweight championship, beating Ramon 'Angel' Alegre at the London Docklands Arena, London on Feb 14th 1990 with a KO in round 6, in an entertaining and gritty contest that was billed as the ""Valentines Day Massacre"". In 1991 he challenged the colorful and eccentric Chris Eubank for the WBO world middleweight championship in London. 'Beauty v The Best' attracted the big celebrity crowd, and was a major sporting event that year. Despite taking the bout after almost a year out of the sport, Gary gave the iron-chinned champion hell for five rounds before the fight was stopped in the sixth round. After many unsuccessful attempts for a rematch, Stretch had one more fight then retired with a record of 23-2-0. Post-boxing, Gary was looking for another challenge and turned to the art of acting, In 2004, his hard work finally paid off when he was cast as psychotic gangster Sonny in Shane Meadows highly acclaimed ""Dead Man's Shoes"" Shane Meadows' a gritty cult thrillerDead Man's Shoes - Cinque giorni di vendetta (2004).

However, turning his talents in a different direction during the 1970s, Ray became one of the most influential publicists in Hollywood through his work with some of the biggest names in the world of entertainment. The urge to act never left and Ray made his triumphant return to the stage to become ""the most award-honored L.A. stage actor of the 1980s"". Among others, he was twice named Best Actor of the Year by the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle, and twice nominated for a Golden Globe for acting. Ray has guest-starred in a number of the top television series since his return, however it was his now- legendary performance as Tennessee Williams in ""Confessions of a Nightingale"", which received national acclaim with his performances in Los Angeles, New York, and other major cities across North America.","October 8, 1928 in Houston, Texas, USA",1928-10-08,"Houston, Texas, USA","May 14, 2002 in Los Angeles, California, USA  (emphysema)",2002-05-14,"Los Angeles, California, USA  ",emphysema,,0,0,0,0

Both of these novels were made into films.In the mid-eighties his novels of nuclear destruction, Warday and Wolf of Shadows, became a New York Times bestseller (co-authored by James Kunetka) and an award winning young-adult novel, respectively. Costa-Gavras was briefly attached to a planned feature film adaptation of Warday.Whitley Strieber is perhaps best known for the third phase of his career, which began with Communion (1989), an autobiographical account of his experiences with strange alien ""visitors"" who he says came to his cabin in the New York countryside. This Number 1 New York Times Non-Fiction Bestseller (on the list for 15 weeks) was also turned into a film. He appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson (6 May 1987) to defend his sincerity.After leaving New York, he returned to the vampire saga that began with Miriam si sveglia a mezzanotte (1983), adding the novels The Last Vampire and Lilith's Dream to the mythology. When Columbia Pictures' option on The Last Vampire expired, the SciFi Channel considered a mini-series based on the last two novels of the trilogy.He has written several other thrillers, and two novels about environmental apocalypse, Nature's End and The Coming Global Superstorm. Superstorm served as an inspiration for Fox's The Day After Tomorrow - L'alba del giorno dopo (2004), and Strieber later penned the novelization of that film.His 2006 novel, The Grays, is a fictional narrative about ""an alien presence struggling with humanity for control of the earth"" that is, he says, informed by his personal experiences.

He published his novel 'Röda rummet' in 1879, a novel critical towards the press, the church, the publishers, the parliament and the state departments. With it he started the realism of the 1880s in Swedish literature. By the middle of the 1880s he had enemies everywhere and moved to Switzerland. With his novels 'Giftas' his hostility towards women increased, partly as a result of marital problems. His spoof of the holy communion lead to charges of blasphemy. At the end of the 1880s he wrote several novels about life in the archipelago, for example the successful novel 'Hemsöborna'. At the beginning of the 1890s he was briefly married to the Austrian 'Frida Uhl'. After the divorce he moved to Paris and studied ocultism and alchemy. He suffered from a psychological crisis.

nm0834626,Elaine Stritch,Elaine Stritch,171,"A brash, sharp-tongued, incorrigible actress/singer who led a six decade career that contained many highs and lows, veteran Elaine Stritch's raucous six-decade career certainly lived up well to the Stephen Sondheim song lyrics ""I'm Still Here."" A popular, magnetic performer, she stole so many moments on stage she could have been convicted of grand larceny This tough old bird approached her octogenarian years with still-shapely legs, a puffy blonde hairdo, a deep, whiskey voice and enough sardonic bluster and bravado to convince anyone that she would be around forever.The Detroit-born (February 2, 1925) Elaine Stritch was the daughter of a B.F. Goodrich executive, of Irish/Welsh heritage, and the youngest of three sisters. Educated locally at Sacred Heart Convent and Duschesne Residence Finishing School, she prepared for the stage at the Dramatic Workshop of the New School where fellow ""school mates"" included Marlon Brando. She made her first appearance at the New School as a tiger and a cow in a 1944 children's production entitled ""Babino,"" then followed it the following year with the part of a parlor maid in ""The Private Life of the Master Race.""Elaine made it to Broadway in October 1946 as ""Pamela Brewster"" in ""Loco"" at the Biltmore Theatre. Taking over the part of ""Miss Crowder"" in ""Made in Heaven"" after that, she finished off the decade appearing in such theatre productions as ""Three Indelicate Ladies,"" ""The Little Foxes"" (as Regina), the revue ""Angel in the Wings"" and ""Yes M'Lord.""From the 1950's on, Elaine would become the toast of both Broadway and (later) London's West End, earning award-worthy acclaim on both continents over the years. Starting with a tour of ""Pal Joey"" (as Melba) in 1952, she followed this success with such shows as ""Call Me Madam"" (as Sally); ""On Your Toes"" (as Peggy); ""Bus Stop"" (Tony nom: as waitress Grace), ""The Sin of Pat Muldoon"" (as Gertrude); ""Goldilocks"" (as Maggie); ""Sail Away!"" (Tony nom, and also London debut as Mimi); ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (as Martha); ""The King and I"" (as Anna); ""The Grass Harp"" (as Babylove); ""Wonderful Town"" (as Ruth); ""Private Lives"" (as Amanda); ""Mame"" (as Vera, then Mame); ""Company"" (Tony-nom: as Joanne); ""Small Craft Warnings"" (as Leona); ""The Gingerbread Lady"" (as Evy); ""Show Boat"" (Drama Desk Award: as Parthy); and ""A Delcate Balance"" (Tony-nom, Drama Desk Award: as Claire). Through sheer personality alone, her cacophonous singing voice miraculously took classic songs from, among others, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart to Noël Coward and Stephen Sondheim and put her own indelibly raucous stamp on them.Oddly, Elaine never made the same kind of impact on film. Nevertheless, she appeared in an armful of supports over the years, growing increasingly abrasive, in such movies as L'ora scarlatta (1956), I violenti (1956), Addio alle armi (1957), In licenza a Parigi (1958), Kiss Her Goodbye (1959), Il sadico (1965), L'emblema di Viktor (1966), Piccioni (1970), Delitto in silenzio (1975), Providence (1977), Settembre (1987), Cocoon - Il ritorno (1988), Cadillac Man - Mister occasionissima (1990), Gli impenitenti (1997), Cercasi tribù disperatamente (1998), Screwed - Due criminali da strapazzo (2000), Criminali da strapazzo (2000); Autumn in New York (2000), Quel mostro di suocera (2005), ParaNorman (2012) and River of Fundament (2014)The actress fared somewhat better on early TV. She appeared as one of the Paynes in the early Dumont family comedy series The Growing Paynes (1948), and made appearances on several anthology series (""Kraft Theatre,"" ""Goodyear Playhouse,"" ""The Alcoa Hour,"" ""The Dupont Show of the Month""). A few guest spots also decorated her small screen resume, including ""Mister Peepers,"" ""Adventures in Paradise"" and ""Wagon Train"". In the 60's, Elaine returned to the series format, but only enjoyed single season life on three: My Sister Eileen (1960), as Ruth Sherwood; the acclaimed Le cause dell'avvocato O' Brien (1965) as lawyer Peter Falk's secretary ""Miss G.""; and as Ellen Burstyn's derisive mother on The Ellen Burstyn Show (1986).In 1973, Elaine married English actor John Bay and moved to London. While there she appeared in a number of plays/musicals and then played an American authoress in the British comedy series Two's Company (1975) co-starring Donald Sinden as the butler. When she returned to America in the early 80's, she returned alone.At age 76, a razor-sharp Elaine captivated audiences in a candid one woman musical stage memoir that would win her the Tony, Drama Desk, Obie, Outer Circle Critics and New York Drama Critics awards. Elaine Stritch at Liberty (2002) show also chronicled her notorious private life, combative nature, which included a long bout with the bottle (to curb her stage fright), and a destructive relationship with fellow alcoholic Gig Young. Add to that a fair share of Hollywood gossip all cleverly packaged up with raw wit and show-stopping patter songs and you had quintessential Elaine Stritch. Truly one of a kind, she would eventually be inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1995.Other memorable TV appearances included her Aunt Polly in the mini-series Pollyanna (1973); a 1984 continuing role on the daytime soaper Ai confini della notte (1956); the role of Ouisar in the TV movie version of Steel Magnolias (1990); and three Emmy Award-winning portrayals -- as a guest on ""Law & Order,"" for the 2004 TV documentary of her one-woman triumph, and for a recurring character on the hit sitcom 30 Rock (2006).A diabetic, it took stomach cancer to finally slow this woman down at the end, dying at age 89 on July 17, 2014, at her Michigan home.","February 2, 1925 in Detroit, Michigan, USA",1925-02-02,"Detroit, Michigan, USA","July 17, 2014 in Birmingham, Michigan, USA  (stomach cancer)",2014-07-17,"Birmingham, Michigan, USA  ",stomach cancer,John Bay  (27 February 1973 - 7 November 1982) (his death),1,0,0,0

nm0834696,Frank Strobel,Frank Strobel,,"Frank Strobel, who believes in transcending perceived divisions between artistic genres, is renowned as a conductor, arranger, editor, producer and studio musician. He has been active for many years in the space where films meet music and is a leading figure in the field of film in concert. He has taken silent movies into opera houses and concert halls and is also admired as a conductor of concert repertoire of the Classical and Romantic eras and the 20th century.Born in Munich in 1966, Strobel grew up in his parents' cinema and gained skills as a projectionist at an early age. He remains fascinated by film and soundtracks. As a 16-year-old he obtained a piano score of Gottfried Huppertz's original music for Fritz Lang's cinematic masterpiece METROPOLIS, which he rearranged and then played to accompany the film, arrangements have since been performed numerous times. METROPOLIS again played a determining role in Strobel's career after an original copy of the film was discovered in 2008 in Buenos Aires. He played an active role in its reconstruction, having recreated Huppertz's scores for both METROPOLIS and Lang's two-part film DIE NIBELUNGEN. The much-anticipated premiere of the restored version of METROPOLIS took place at the 2010 Berlin International Film Festival with Strobel conducting the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra. It was broadcast live on the TV channel arte and projected onto Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.Strobel is also in demand internationally for performances of music by the late-Romantic composers Franz Schreker, Alexander von Zemlinsky and Siegfried Wagner, whose works he has both revived and premiered. His open-minded musical philosophy struck a chord with the great Russian-born composer Alfred Schnittke, who came to see Strobel as an ideal interpreter of his works and commissioned him to make concert suites from a selection of his 60 or so film scores; this led to recordings with the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, which in 2005 and 2006 received the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis. Recordings of Schnittke's three piano concertos, with Eva Kupiec as soloist have also been released. As early as 1992 Strobel had conducted the world premiere in Frankfurt's Alte Oper of Schnittke's END OF ST PETERSBURG, written to accompany Vsevolod Pudovkin's silent film. Strobel also reconstructed and published Prokofiev's score for Eisenstein's ALEXANDER NEVSKY, conducting the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra in the world premiere of his edition at the German capital's Konzerthaus in 2004; this was followed by a performance at Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre. In 2006, at Dresden's Semperoper Strobel conducted the Sächsische Staatskapelle for a screening of Robert Wiene's 1925 film of DER ROSENKAVALIER, with the reconstructed Strauss' original orchestral score. A much more recent film, the science fiction extravaganza THE MATRIX was screened at London's Royal Albert Hall in 2011, with Don Davis' score performed live by the NDR Radiophilharmonie Hannover under Strobel. The event was subsequently repeated elsewhere. 2014 brought the commemoration of the outbreak of World War I with the world premiere at the Salle Pleyel in Paris of Philippe Schoeller's newly-written score for Abel Gance's 1919 film, J'ACCUSE; Frank Strobel conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France. In 2016 Frank Strobel realised the reconstructed film IWAN GROZNY by Sergei Eisenstein, which was premiered at the Musikfest Berlin, performed by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (RSB) and the Berlin Radio Choir. This ""film opera"", which contains the complete music in its' original orchestration by Sergei Prokofiev as well as chants of the Russian-Orthodox liturgy, Frank Strobel also performed with the Radio Symphony Orchestra Vienna for the closing of their 2016-2017 season at the Konzerthaus Vienna.Frank Strobel enjoys close relationships in Germany with Berlin Radio Symphony, Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, Frankfurt Radio Symphony, MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony, NDR Radio Philharmonic Hannover, Staatskapelle Weimar and internationally with the Finnish Radio Symphony, London Symphony, Orchestre National de Lyon and Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg orchestras; and with major concert halls such as the Cologne Philharmonie, the Paris Philharmonie and the Vienna Konzerthaus.In the 2017/2018 season, among Frank Strobel's many film-related concerts are THE LOVE OF JEANNE NEY with the WDR Funkhausorchester Cologne, ALEXANDER NEVSKY with the Finnish Radio Symphony, October with the London Symphony, DER ROSENKAVALIER with the Staatsphilharmonie Nürnberg, THREE WISHES FOR CINDERELLA with the Staatskapelle Weimar, THE ARTIST with the Berlin Radio Symphony, TARTUFF with the Radio Symphony Vienna and BLANCANIEVES with the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestras. Return engagements include Tonhalle Zurich, Qatar Philharmonic, Gothenburg Symphony, MDR Leipzig Radio Symphony, Norddeutsche Philharmonie Rostock and NDR Radio Philharmonic Hannover orchestras. He dedicates two extensive evenings to ""Cinéma Variété"" with the orchestra of Komische Oper Berlin and gives his debut with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Philharmonie in Paris. A programme devoted to Robert Mitchum will be realised with Bremer Philharmoniker and singer Dominique Horwitz.Frank Strobel was Chief Conductor of the German Film Orchestra Babelsberg, he acts as an adviser to ZDF/arte for its silent film programming. In 2000, he co-founded with Beate Warkentien the EUROPEAN FILMPHILHARMONIC INSTITUTE. This cultural institution has built a reputation for its expertise in authentic performances of film scores.","1966 in Munich, Bavaria, Germany","1966 in Munich, Bavaria, Germany","Munich, Bavaria, Germany",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0835021,Michael Strong,Cecil Natapoff,179,"While never one of the big names on screen, Michael Strong was one of those excellent method actors who were often compelling to watch. Unsurprisingly, many of Michael's screen characters were typical New Yorkers, whether they be cops or thugs, and he imbued them with an edgy 'in-your-face' intensity that was all his own. He was already an established stage actor, both on and off-Broadway, with an extensive resume to his name long before transferring his talents to the screen. A graduate of the Actor's Studio, he was also part of the original crew of the Lincoln Center Repertory Company, performing in key plays by Arthur Miller, S.N. Behrman and Eugene O'Neill. Usually assigned to playing military types or proletarian firebrands, Michael eventually came to note as a young burglar in ""Detective Story"", written and staged on Broadway by Sidney Kingsley in 1949. Director William Wyler subsequently brought him to Hollywood to recreate his role for the 1951 motion picture.A couple of other good roles Michael later enacted for the big screen were his smarmy used-car salesman Stegman in the thriller Senza un attimo di tregua (1967) and Brigadier General Hobart Carver in the Oscar-winning war drama Patton, generale d'acciaio (1970). For the most part, however, television became Michael's most prolific medium. His furtive looks and nervous demeanor often suggested that his characters had something to hide - and most of them did, particularly those Eastern bloc spy types with names like Malkov and Petrovich. He was at home in just about every major police series of the period, equally adept at NYPD sergeants and contract assassins. Fans of Star Trek (1966) will also remember Michael as the unhinged Dr. Roger Korby who had his consciousness transferred into an android body in the episode ""What Are Little Girls Made Of?"". As tough as some of his characters, Michael continued to act right up until the end.","February 8, 1918 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA",1918-02-08,"Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","September 29, 1980 in Los Angeles, California, USA  (cancer)",1980-09-29,"Los Angeles, California, USA  ",cancer,"Diane Shalet  (24 August 1969 - 29 September 1980) (his death)

nm0835329,Joe Strummer,John Graham Mellor,173,"Although best known as the outspoken front man for legendary punk rock group The Clash, Joe Strummer also carved out an interesting niche as an actor once the band broke up. The Clash formed in 1976, and along with the Sex Pistols spearheaded the British punk rock scene. By 1979, The Clash had broadened their musical horizons at a time when most punk bands were painting themselves into a corner. By the early 1980s, The Clash were filling stadiums around the world; ultimately, trying to reconcile punk ethics with stardom took its toll on the band. The original line-up dissolved in 1983, and but with new members, Strummer soldiered on for a couple years longer. Ultimately embarrassed that The Clash had become a strange parody of itself, he split up the band once and for all, and then kept a low profile for a few years. When he returned, he decided to branch out in a new direction: acting.Strummer first appeared on film playing himself in Rude Boy (1980), a quasi documentary look at The Clash through the misadventures of a young roadie who tours with the band. His first proper role as an actor was as the grimy gangster Simms in Alex Cox's cult classic Diritti all'inferno (1987). Apparently Strummer employed the method school of acting on the shoot, not changing his clothes for days in the hot Spanish sun.His next notable appearance was as English Johnny in Jim Jarmusch's excellent Mystery Train - Martedì notte a Memphis (1989), a role clearly written for him by Jarmusch. His last appearance - speaking all of his dialogue in French - was in _Docteur Chance (1997)_ . Although not a professional actor by any means, Strummer's charisma went a long way, and he can be a treat to watch onscreen. Along with his acting work, Strummer also composed several film scores, including the excellent Walker - Una storia vera (1987) and the raucous soundtrack to Il peso del ricordo (1988).After more than 10 years with only sporadic musical output, Strummer returned in a big way with the excellent 1999 album Rock Art & The X-Ray Style. With his new band, The Mescaleros, Strummer enjoyed a strong comeback that put him back in the spotlight. Sadly, just a few months before The Clash were due to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, Strummer died of a congenital heart condition at the still young age of 50. His death came as a shock to fans around the world.","August 21, 1952 in Ankara, Turkey",1952-08-21,"Ankara, Turkey","December 22, 2002 in Broomfield, Somerset, England, UK  (heart attack)",2002-12-22,"Broomfield, Somerset, England, UK  ",heart attack,Lucinda Mellor  (30 May 1995 - 22 December 2002) (his death),1,0,0,0

nm0835725,Jason Stuart,Stuart Ted Greif,,"After years of steady work in film and television, and approaching 150 credits on his IMDB page, actor and comedian Jason Stuart has achieved a pinnacle of success many actors only dream of. ""For the last few years, people have started to approach me and say, 'You're that guy,'"" he explains with his characteristic gravelly laugh. Indeed, with guest-starring and supporting credits in everything from Judd Apatow's ""Love"" to ""My Wife and Kids"" to ""Tangerine"" and ""The Birth of a Nation,"" Stuart has now established himself as one of those all-too-familiar faces who might just pop up anywhere, in any kind of role.It's just the latest remarkable but true chapter in the career of Stuart, a longtime veteran of stand-up comedy, born in the Bronx and raised in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles. A self-described insecure Jewish kid who turned to theatre and performing to mask his emerging sexual identity - he jokes about going to see Barbra Streisand in ""Funny Girl"" as a youth and falling in love with Omar Sharif. His talent and determination got him some early professional work in films like ""Kindergarten Cop,"" ""Vegas Vacation,"" and TV shows like ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""The Drew Carey Show."" But by the early-90s, frustrated by years of living in the closet, Stuart chose to come out publicly on an episode of Geraldo Rivera's talk show focused on ""Unconventional Comedians.""That led to a wave of interest in Stuart as a ""gay comedian,"" giving his act new material and energy, and a purpose (his sexuality, as a Los Angeles Times article from 1995 states, is ""a full-time job""). Today, Stuart marvels at how much has changed about the visibility of sexually diverse actors and celebrities, having experienced the transition from ""closeted"" to ""gay"" to ""queer."" ""That was such a negative word, 'queer,'"" he says. ""It was a word 'they' would call you and it still takes some getting used to, but I can see how things are changing. And of course, I'm not just gay or queer, it's just a part of who I am: I'm also a Jew, a man of a certain age, a lover, a friend and a son. But it's always a part of who I am.""Just as his identity as a gay man has not fully defined his career, Stuart is also proud of how he has kept his reputation as a comedian while still flourishing as an actor. ""I've always thought about myself as an actor first, comedian second,"" he says. ""When I think of what I want to do with the next phase of my career, I think about being a great character actor. I revered the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, his ability to always disappear into his characters, no matter the role. He was a character actor who happened to be a movie star.""A look at Stuart's most recent work underscores this, notably playing a similar part - a detective in a crime drama - in two wildly different ways. In Prince Bagdasarian's ""Abducted,"" he plays a police sidekick - ""My version of J. K. Simmons or Paul Giamatti,"" he explains citing two more character actor role models. ""I played him like my brother, who has been slightly irritated his entire life."" On the other side of the coin is the private detective character Stuart creates in Jon Dabach's ""Immortal,"" a new thriller co-starring Samm Levine and Dylan Baker. ""He's much more powerful and intimidating.""For Stuart, one of the most significant moments in his recent career was being cast as Joseph Randall, one of the villainous plantation owners at the wrong end of a rebellion in Nate Parker's searing historical drama, ""The Birth of a Nation."" Being cast by Parker was a sign for Stuart that he had turned the corner from funny gay comic to established character actor. ""I remember Nate saying to me that part of what he wanted was my activism,"" he recalls. ""He wanted advocates for different communities, and he knew that I'd represented not just the LGBTQ community, but I've worked on behalf of Black Lives Matter, the homeless, youth, and Jewish causes.""At the same time, taking on the role of an empowered racist in 1831 Virginia also allowed Stuart to reflect on his own evolving complex identity. ""How can I be gay and Jewish and have white privilege?"" he found himself wondering through working on Parker's film. ""It helped me establish this new part of my career, and it changed me as an actor and a human being,"" he says of the experience. ""To tell the history of this man, Nat Turner, who had the audacity, tenaciousness and self-esteem as a black man, in 1831, to stand up against his slave owners knowing he would be murdered. Is he mentally ill? A martyr? Touched by God? To be part of that story, to work with talented people like Nate Parker and Armie Hammer, was exactly what I wanted my career to be about.""These days, Stuart keeps his comedy chops polished through stand-up gigs all over the country and his new weekly radio gig with Dash Radio (""Riffing with Jason Stuart""). He continues to serve as the National Co-Chairman of the SAG-AFTRA lgbtq Committee, and has a memoir about to be published from CCB Publishing (""Shut Up, I'm Talking!"") He's also just completed a number of projects, including a new comedy web series ""Smothered,"" co-created with Mitch Hara; the Sundance hit ""The Infiltrators"" from directors Alex Rivera and Cristina Ibarra; and the high school comedy ""Divios!"" with Marissa Jaret Winokur and Nicole Sullivan. He also just starred in the short ""Hank"" from director Hongyu Li and co-starring Jay Disney, about a gay couple who consider an open relationship, which continues to earn praise at numerous festivals, including winning the Best lgbtq Short at this year's Los Angeles International Film Festival.""It's still a challenge to get the next great role,"" he says of his passion for acting as a career. ""When I was a kid there were three networks, the movies, and the theatre. Now there's a hundred networks, movies that stream on your phones, and theatres, and TV, and pay-per-view, and social media...so how does someone know you?"" he asks. For now, he's happy enough to take on any role and thrive. ""Someone recognized me from both 'My Wife and Kids' and 'The Birth of a Nation,' and they said, 'You're that guy! We used to love you, now we hate you because you play all these villains!' I'm the guy who can do that - I'm 'that guy!'""","January 13, 1959 in Bronx, New York, USA",1959-01-13,"Bronx, New York, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0836328,John Sturges,John Elliott Sturges,188,"John Sturges was an American film director, mostly remembered for his outstanding Western films. In 1992, Sturges was awarded a Golden Boot Award for his lifelong contribution to the Western genre.Sturges was born in the village of Oak Park, Illinois, within the Chicago metropolitan area. By 1930, the village had a population of 64,000 people.Sturges started his film career in 1932, as a film editor. During World War II, he started directing documentaries and training films for the United States Army Air Forces.Sturges made his directing debut in 1946, in the drama film ""The Man Who Dared"" (1946) by the studio Columbia Pictures. The film's protagonist frames himself for murder, in order to prove that innocent people may be convicted by circumstantial evidence. His next film project was the film noir ""Shadowed"" (1946), about a corpse being found in a golf club, and how an innocent man finds his life threatened by a gang leader. Sturges' last film of the year was the crime drama ""Alias Mr. Twilight"" (1946), about an elderly con-artist who uses his earnings to provide for his beloved granddaughter.Sturges was entrusted with directing the third film in the then -popular Rusty film series, about the adventures of a German shepherd. The film was called ""For the Love of Rusty"" (1947), and introduced the new dog actor Flame. Flame portrayed Rusty in four of the eight Rusty films.Sturges' next film project was ""Keeper of the Bees"" (1947), the third film adaptation of the 1925 novel by Gene Stratton-Porter (1863-1924). The film involved aging beekeeper Michael Worthington (played by Harry Davenport ) who recruits a nomadic painter and an orphan girl as his new employees. Despite a high-profile cast, the film is considered a lost film.Sturges' last film of the year was the war documentary ""Thunderbolt"" (1947), concerning Operation Strangle (March 19-May 11, 1944). The aerial operation had American aircraft attacking German supply routes in Central Italy, in order to force the Germans to withdraw. The documentary included actual combat footage from the operation, and part of its profits was used to finance the Army Air Force Relief Society.Sturges returned to the film noir genre with the film ""The Sign of the Ram"" (1948). The film's villain protagonist Leah St. Aubyn (played by Susan Peters) was depicted as an invalid woman with an obsessive desire to control and dominate the life of her family and friends, and going to extremes in order to achieve her goal.Sturges next directed the historical drama ""Best Man Wins"", an adaptation of the short story ""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"" (1865) by Mark Twain (1835-1910). The film depicts professional gambler Jim Smiley (played by Edgar Buchanan) trying to use his jumping frog Daniel Webster to win bets. He hopes to use his earnings to win back the love of his ex-wife, and to buy the love of his estranged son.Sturges' first Western was ""The Walking Hills"" (1949), which used film noir tropes in a new setting. The film involves treasure hunters searching for a lost wagon train carrying gold bars. But many of the characters are hiding secrets, and a there is a manhunt for a wanted fugitive in the area.Sturges had a critically successful film with the biographical film ""The Magnificent Yankee"", which dramatized the life of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (1841-1935), Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1902 to 1932. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, but won neither.Sturges next projects included the film noir ""The Capture"" (1950), the film noir ""Mystery Street"" (1950), and the sports drama ""Right Cross"" (1950). His crime drama ""Kind Lady"" (1951) was a remake of a 1935 film with the same title, directed by George B. Seitz. In the film, wealthy art collector Mary Herries (played by Ethel Barrymore) allows painter Henry Springer Elcott (played by Maurice Evans) to move into her London house. But her new house-guest is planning to rob her.Sturges' film noir ""The People Against O'Hara"" (1951) was a film noir with elements from courtroom drama. It was a box office hit, and had Sturges working with lead actor Spencer Tracy. Sturges was one of seven film directors who co-directed the anthology film ""It's a Big Country"", concerning life in the United States.Sturges' biographical film ""The Girl in White"" (1952) dramatized the life of female surgeon Emily Dunning Barringer (1876-1961). The real-life Barringer was ""the world's first female ambulance surgeon and the first woman to secure a surgical residency"". Sturges returned to the film noir genre with ""Jeopardy"" (1953), an adaptation of a radio play by Maurice Zimm.Sturges directed the sports comedy ""Fast Company"" (1953), about an exceptional race horse, and a struggle over its ownership. He returned to the Western genre with the American Civil War-themed film ""Escape from Fort Bravo"" (1953). In the film the prisoners confined in a Union prison camp attempt to escape. This color film used the Anscocolor process.Sturges had a career highlight with the thriller film ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" (1955), which combined elements from both film noir and the Western. It involves a town hiding a secret, and mysterious stranger John J. Macreedy (played by Spencer Tracy) trying to uncover the elusive truth. Sturges was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, but the award was won instead by rival director Delbert Mann (1920-2007).Sturges' next film project was the treasure-hunting themed adventure ""Underwater!"" (1955). His historical drama ""The Scarlet Coat"" (1955) dramatized the plot of military officer Benedict Arnold (1741-1801) to surrender West Point to the British Army during the American Revolutionary War. The film also dramatized the life of British spy John André (1750-1780).The film's American counterspy John Bolton was loosely based on historical spymaster Benjamin Tallmadge (1754-1835).Sturges returned to the Western genre with popular films such as ""Backlash"" (1956), ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" (1957), ""The Law and Jake Wade"" (1958), ""Last Train from Gun Hill"" (1959). He also directed the adventure drama ""The Old Man and the Sea"" (1958), an adaptation of the 1952 novella by Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961). For this film, Sturges once again worked with leading actor Spencer Tracy.Sturges' World War II-themed war film ""Never So Few"" (1959), featured a cast of rising actors, such as Frank Sinatra, Gina Lollobrigida, and Steve McQueen,. Sturges had another career highlight with a film remake, the Western ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960). It was a loose adaptation of the Japanese film ""Seven Samurai"" (1954) by Akira Kurosawa. The film under-performed in the United States, but was a smash hit in Europe, and very profitable for the film studio United Artists. It sold 89,118,696 tickets sold in overseas territories, and broke box office records in the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Kurosawa himself liked this adaptation, and the film received three sequels, two remakes of its own, and a television series adaptation.Sturges' next film project included the law-firm drama ""By Love Possessed"" (1961), which included controversial themes such as rape, suicide, and embezzlement. Sturges next Western film was ""Sergeants 3"", loosely based on the poem ""Gunga Din"" (1890) by Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936). This film is mostly remembered as the "" last film to feature all five members of the Rat Pack"".Sturges' next film was more sexually explicit: ""A Girl Named Tamiko"" (1962). Lead character Ivan Balin (played by Laurence Harvey) is a man who desperately wants to emigrate to the United States, and uses his sex-appeal to seduce women who may help him achieve his goal. His next war film was ""The Great Escape"" (1963) about prisoners of war trying to escape from Stalag Luft III. It was one of the highest-grossing films of its year of release.Sturges directed his first science fiction film at age 55, and that film was ""The Satan Bug"" (1965). The film depicted the manufacture of bio-weapons, and their potential release against American major cities. Sturges also directed the Western comedy ""The Hallelujah Trail"" (1965), about a predicted harsh winter threatening the whiskey supply of a frontier town. He next directed a more serious Western, ""Hour of the Gun"" (1967). It was his second film about the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1881), but attempted to be more historically accurate than previous film depictions of the events.Sturges' next film project was the Cold War thriller ""Ice Station Zebra"" (1968), loosely based on the missing experimental Corona satellite capsule (Discoverer II) which fell to Norway in 1959, and the efforts to recover it before it fell on Soviet hands. The film was mildly controversial, since it dramatized events that were still classified secret at the time of production. Sturges used former American agents as technical advisers.Sturges' second science fiction film was Marooned (1969), depicting a potentially deadly accident affecting the Apollo program. Released at a time of high public interest on the Apollo program, it attracted an audience but was a box office flop. The film's visual effects expert won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.Sturges partially directed the auto racing film ""Le Mans"" (1971), but quit before the film was completed. He was replaced by fellow director Lee H. Katzin (1935-2002). Sturges returned to the Western genre with the peasant-revolt themed ""Joe Kidd"" (1972). It featured bounty hunter Joe Kidd (played by Clint Eastwood) hunting down a Mexican revolutionary who is campaigning for land reform. The film is considered an example of the Revisionist Western, a more cynical take on the genre.Sturges last Western was the Italian-produced ""Chino"" (1973). He returned to the film noir genre with the neo-noir ""McQ"" (1974), with lead character Lon ""McQ"" McHugh (played by John Wayne) being an aging police detective who is trying find out who was behind a failed attempt on his life. Sturges' last film was the war film ""The Eagle Has Landed"" (1976), depicting a German plot by Abwehr leader Wilhelm Canaris (1887-1945) to kidnap Winston Churchill. His last film was a box office hit in its own right.Sturges retired from film directing at the age of 66. He continued living in retirement until his death in 1992. He was 82-years-old, and several of his film were finding retrospective critical acclaim.","January 3, 1910 in Oak Park, Illinois, USA",1910-01-03,"Oak Park, Illinois, USA","August 18, 1992 in San Luis Obispo, California, USA  (heart attack and emphysema)",1992-08-18,"San Luis Obispo, California, USA  ",heart attack and emphysema,"Katherine Helena Soules  (6 October 1984 - 18 August 1992) (his death)

However, he began to develop a secret passion for acting, at age 8, when he auditioned for local theatre to get out of class. Whilst music appeared cool, he felt being in school plays wasn't. So he stuck with small parts, despite a yearning to be in the lead role. At age 15, he joined a band and they began lying about their ages to play gigs in pubs. At school, he received mostly low grades with the exception of music and drama.For college, he moved to Salford because there was a lot of good music coming out of the Manchester scene. In the hopes of joining a new band, he undertook a Higher National Diploma in Media Performance at Salford University. It was here that he met people that were really interested in filmmaking, and it suddenly felt like a possible career move. He began making short films with his friends and as well as doing theater. He wrote and performed a one-man show, which led an actor in the audience to suggest Jim to his agent. The agent signed him without even meeting him.Jim moved back to London in 2000, where he joined the band 'Saint Faith'. He had moved to Manchester to join a band, and instead fell into acting. He moved back to London for acting, and ended up joining a band. He took small roles on television to fund his life as a musician.Problems began in the band in 2006, and Jim heard of an audition for the musical film Across the Universe (2007). He won the leading male role of Jude. He followed this film with L'altra donna del re (2008) with Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson. His breakthrough role came with Dexter in One Day (2011), based on the bestselling book by David Nicholls.

A tough role, handled well, saw Tom go from strength to strength as an actor. In that same year he played a blink-and-you'll-miss role in a bizarre mock documentary about two conjoined twins turned rock stars called 'Brothers Of The Head'.In 2006, Tom took a part in a psychological thriller called 'Like Minds' (also known as 'Murderous Intent) and although that movie may have failed on some levels, it was the chilling performance by Tom Sturridge that won most of the positive notices.Next it was rumoured that Tom Sturridge was supposed to be cast in the big Hollywood production 'Jumper', but was dropped in favour of a bigger star in the form of Hayden Christensen.Next, in 2009, after a near three-year absence from the big screen, Tom returned in an all star comedy called 'The Boat That Rocked', directed by Richard Curtis. The fine cast also included Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rhys Ifans and Bill Nighy.Although the movie didn't set the box office on fire, it did further show Tom's potential as a future leading man.Next, stepping up his acting credentials even further, Tom appeared in a stage play called 'Punk Rock'. So good was he in that role, he won the 2009 Critics' Circle Theatre Award.Upcoming movies 'Waiting For Forever', 'Junkhearts' and 'On The Road' promise to continue Tom's ascendancy as one of the UK's best new actors.Tom has a younger brother and sister, Matilda Sturridge and Arthur Sturridge; both have followed Tom into the acting profession.","December 21, 1985 in Lambeth, London, England, UK",1985-12-21,"Lambeth, London, England, UK",,,,,,0,0,0,0

Shy and soft spoken Robinson comes from a family of performers where both his siblings, older brother Sagamore Stévenin and younger sister Salomé Stévenin are also actors. Robinson started acting at the tender age of 5 in his fathers second feature Double messieurs (1986). Then followed many roles in TV movies and plays and small supporting roles in films like L'hydrolution (1989) and La révolte des enfants (1992) for which he got his first nomination and award for Best Actor at the Paris Film Festival at just the age of 10, this being a hint at further great things to come from this gifted actor. The young actor then took on a series of selective television roles shunning down most movie offers to ""grow"" as an actor. The young actor then took on two very delicate roles, that of the conniving sly Laurent in Mauvaises fréquentations (1999) as a boy who obliges his girlfriend with a prostituer which earned him his first César of the Best Male hope in 2000 and that as Bo a shy, young transvestite in Francis Girod's Mauvais genres (2001) which earned him second successive César Award - and this time winning - for Best Male Hope. Possessing a chameleon-like ability to portray a range of characters, Robinson has firmly established himself as one of France's most gifted actors. This was followed by collaborating with his father again for Mischka (2002), then having a very small supporting role in Deux (2002) as a young stranger on a bike who charms Isabelle Huppert. He was then seen in a scene-stealing performance in Son frère (2003). Robinson takes on selective, picky roles regardless of how big or small the role is. He was then seen in Claude Miller's La petite Lili (2003) where he met and bonded with co-star Ludivine Sagnier. He can next be seen in Mon colonel (2006) as Guy Rossi an officer lawyer confronted with the reality of torture during the War of Algeria, a first film written and produced by Costa-Gavras. Then in the highly controversial Transe (2006), followed by the eagerly awaited C'est beau une ville la nuit (2006) and Attrici (2007).","March 1, 1981 in Lons-le-Saunier, Jura, France",1981-03-01,"Lons-le-Saunier, Jura, France",,,,,,0,0,0,0

He made a handful of German silents beginning in 1926 and had moved with ease into sound pictures.The Nazi invasion of Austria forced Stossel to emigrate to the United Kingdom in 1938. He rekindled his film career there but moved to America within a couple years. Many German and Austrian actors left their countries because of the Nazi takeover and emigrated to the US, winding up in Hollywood where they formed a sort of ""colony"", often being used in war-themed dramas to play either refugees or Nazi officers and officials. Stossel found a plethora of work that made use of his thick accent and benevolent countenance, his balding characters often accompanied by a monocle and handlebar mustache. He provided secondary but memorable foreign characters in such WWII classics as Casablanca (1942), Delitti senza castigo (1942), and the Lou Gehrig biopic L'idolo delle folle (1942) as Gehrig's (Gary Cooper) father.Firmly established in Hollywood, the amiable Stossel continued playing sweet and wise old souls throughout the remainder of his career. Particularly outstanding was his role as Albert Einstein in La morte è discesa a Hiroshima (1947). He also worked on TV in the 1950s and is perhaps best remembered for his long series of commercials for Italian Swiss Colony wine in which he played ""that little old winemaker, me!"" in Swiss costume.

Born in London on May 2, 1946, the son of actress Joan Patricia Jarché and renowned Lithuanian-Jewish obstetrician and gynecologist Jack Suchet, David, following boarding school, took an early desire in acting and was given a membership with the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain at age 16. He then studied for three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts and, after a significant route in repertory work, became a company member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1973 where he evolved into one of its most dominant players.In the 1970s Suchet also began to come into his own on British television. In classical tradition, his first television movie was Le due città (1980). His first cinematic detective was as a Greek inspector in the Disney mystery-comedy Giallo a Malta (1983). This was followed by a versatile range of film roles that also express the width of his acting nationalities, such as a Middle Eastern terrorist in La tamburina (1984), a Russian operative in Il gioco del falco (1985), a French hunter in Bigfoot e i suoi amici (1987), a Polish bishop in Un prete da uccidere (1988) and the emperor Napoleon in Sabotage! (2000).Suchet's masterful work in television roles also includes portrayals of historical, biblical, entertainment and fictional figures, such as Sigmund Freud in Freud (1984), news reporter William L. Shirer in Murrow (1986), Aaron in Mosè (1995), movie mogul Louis B. Mayer in RKO 281 - La vera storia di Quarto potere (1999), Cardinal Wolsey in Henry VIII (2003)), vampire nemesis Van Helsing in Dracula (2006) and Robert Maxwell in Maxwell (2007).Suchet's memorable theatre incarnations have included Shakespearean interps of Iago in ""Othello"", Tybalt in ""Romeo and Juliet"", Caliban in ""The Tempest"" and the title role of ""Timon of Athens,"" as well as vibrant classical roles such as George in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" (1996), as composer Salieri in ""Amadeus"" (1998), a mesmerizing performance that earned both Olivier and Tony nominations, as Joe Keller in ""All My Sons"" (2010), as James Tyrone in ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" (2012) (and in the 2014 film), as Lady Bracknell in ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" (2015) (and in the 2015 film) and as Gregory Solomon in ""The Price"" (2019).Long wed to former actress Sheila Ferris, the couple has a son and daughter. His older brother is BBC newscaster-turned-journalist John Suchet.

nm0837183,Hermann Sudermann,Hermann Sudermann,,"German playwright and novelist Hermann Sudermann was born into a poor family in Matziken, East Prussia, in 1857. His father was a brewer and descended from a line of very strict fundamentalist Mennonite Christians; one of his ancestors, Daniel Sudermann, was a Protestant clergyman who played a major role in fomenting the religious wars that wracked Europe in the 18th century.As a young boy Hermann was apprenticed to a pharmacist but he detested the smell of the medicines and formulas in the pharmacy and ran away. He attended Konigsburg University, where he studied history and philology. However, he chafed at the restrictions and conventions of academic life at the time, and one day just stood up in the middle of a class and left, never to return.He next showed up in Berlin, attempting to break into legitimate theatre as a writer, but met with such little success that he was forced to take a job as a private tutor in order to survive. He managed to get a job as an editor on a small political weekly, but eventually turned out a few novels that met with some success, ""Frau Sorge"" and ""Geschwister"", and in 1889 his play ""Die Ehre"" was produced in Berlin. In 1890 his novel ""Katzensteg"" (aka ""Regina"") attracted attention for its sympathetic portrayals of the poor and downtrodden.His 1891 novel ""Sodoms Ende"" was declared ""immoral"" and temporarily banned by court order. His next work, however, is undoubtedly his most famous: the play ""Heimat"" (aka ""Magda""), a major hit on stage (and a favorite of such stage luminaries as Sarah Bernhardt, Eleanora Duse ad Mrs. Patrick Campbell).Apart from the occasional novel, Sudermann concentrated on writing plays for the next several years, but not entirely successfully. He actually achieved more success as a novelist than as a playwright, although the modern perception of him is generally exactly the opposite.He died in Berlin, Germany, in 1928.","September 30, 1857 in Matzicken, East Prussia, Prussia [now Macikai, Lithuania]",1857-09-30,"Matzicken, East Prussia, Prussia [now Macikai, Lithuania]","November 21, 1928 in Berlin, Germany  (stroke and pneumonia)",1928-11-21,"Berlin, Germany  ",stroke and pneumonia,Clara Lauckner  (1891 - 17 October 1924) (her death) (1 child),1,0,1,1

Upon graduation from high school she worked in the public sector as an office worker around the end of World War II. However, she always wanted to become an actress and did not want to give up on her dream despite the steady and stable work. She joined the Haiyuza Theatre company despite her father's objection. He explained that actresses are beautiful women, which precludes her. She picked Sugai Kin as her alias as it bore a similarity to her birth name in Japanese. Her father died in 1971 and never saw her act. She began acting in 1947 and her film debut came in January 1951 when she appeared in Kaze Ni Soyogu Ashi ('Reeds That Rustle in the Wind'). In just the next decade she appeared in masterpieces of cinema like The Bad Sleep Well, Ikiru and The Human Condition. She went on to appear in over one hundred and fifty films, as well as on stage in the theatre. Her cross mother-in-law character in the 1973 TV serial Hissatsu Shiokinin ('Person Who Wants To Get Revenge') became so well-known that she wanted to quit the role fearing that, based on her image, her daughter in real life would not find a husband. She went on to accumulate multiple maternal roles. Sugai won the 1985 Japan Academy Prize for Best Supporting Actress for her role in 1984's The Funeral, which was directed by Juzo Itami. Sugai was awarded the Purple Ribbon Medal by the Japanese government in 1990. She was in big and small screen films in 2010, but fell and broke her leg in that year and finding it difficult to walk, despite rehabilitation, decided to retire. She had married Sugai Kin and remained with him until his death in 1996. Sugai obtained a spot in the Guinness Book Of Records as the oldest actress in a main role for her participation in the film My Grandma in 2008. She was eighty-two years old at the time. She liked to play the shamisen. She was never a good cook. Sugai spent the last five years of her life in an old people's home.","February 28, 1926 in Tokyo, Japan",1926-02-28,"Tokyo, Japan","August 10, 2018 in Tokyo, Japan  (heart attack)",2018-08-10,"Tokyo, Japan  ",heart attack,Masayuki Satô  (? - 1996) (his death) (1 child),1,0,1,1

nm0837570,Ilya Surguchev,Ilya Dmitrievich Surguchev,,"After getting his college degree in Oriental languages (St Petersburg Univ., 1907), Ilya Surguchev became a writer who attracted the attention of the famous Maxim Gorky (Gor'kii). Through his ""Znanie Press"", Gorky helped to get Surguchev's first stories and first novel (""The Governor,"" 1912) published. Surguchev's biggest success came when he was only 34, with his stage play ""Autumn Violins"" (performed at the Moscow Art Theater, 1915). Like several other successful creative people, Surguchev left Russia after the Communist Revolution, and lived the rest of his days (1920-1956) in Western Europe, where he continued to write and publish, although not with the same success as the romantic drama ""Violins"" back in the teens. That hit stage play was translated to English & published in New York (entitled simply ""Autumn,"" 1924), although apparently not performed on Broadway or filmed at that time. Surguchev earned some money from the film industry (Fox Studio) in 1935, when he contributed to the script of ""Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo"" with Ronald Colman. This apparently attracted the attention of Fox Studio's famous Russian-born actor-director Gregory Ratoff (Grigorii Ratov or Baratov), who collaborated with British writer Margaret Kennedy to do another English adaptation of the Russian play ""Autumn Violins"" in the late 1930s. Ratoff's version, however, was laid aside due to WW2, and it was not until 1949 that Ratoff finally converted it to film, when he had left Fox Studio and was working abroad. This time Surguchev's romantic drama ""Autumn Violins"" was completely retitled as ""That Dangerous Age,"" starring Myrna Loy and Roger Livesey. When Ratoff-Surguchev's film was later imported to the US, it was re-re-titled, as ""If This Be Sin""! But so long as Surguchev was paid for his literary contribution, 34 years after he'd written it, perhaps he did not complain too much...","February 15, 1881 in Stavropol, Russian Empire [now Russia]",1881-02-15,"Stavropol, Russian Empire [now Russia]","November 19, 1956 in Paris, France",1956-11-19,"Paris, France",,,0,0,0,0

In the latter, Barbara won critical kudos portraying a cynical, manipulative singer/hooker who sets her sights on an unsuspecting town politician played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. Following Fassbinder's sudden death in 1982, Barbara was gloriously displayed in a couple of stark, brilliant, politically-motivated films by director Margarethe von Trotta. In Anni di piombo (1981), Barbara won both the Venice Film Festival and German Film awards and as _Rosa Luxemburg (1986)_ , she copped the Cannes Film Festival award. A number of international productions, notably Lars von Trier's Europa (1991), brought Barbara to the attention of Hollywood. Although not well known here by name, this fascinating figure has added her exotic allure to a number of American films including Il siciliano (1987), M. Butterfly (1993), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), Il prezzo della libertà (1999) and the just-completed Romance & Cigarettes (2005), which was written and directed by John Turturro. Barbara started up a second career as a concert vocalist in recent years, performing works by such classical composers as Arnold Schönberg, among others.","February 2, 1950 in Bremen, Germany",1950-02-02,"Bremen, Germany",,,,,"Robert Longo  (1993 - present)

One of Sullivan's first rules is that any negative can be turned into positive.Born prematurely in 1947, Tom was given too much oxygen while in an incubator. Though it saved his life, it cost him his eyesight. The ""inconvenience"" of being blind has never kept Tom Sullivan from competing in a world where he realized that to be equal, for him, meant that he must be better. Even as he may have had to change the rules slightly, he has proven that one need not be limited by a handicap, whether it is playing backyard baseball as a youngster or any activity he's pursued. Tom is an excellent golfer, an avid snow skier, remarkable marathon runner and has been inducted into the Wrestling Hall of Fame in Stillwater, Oklahoma.Having spent the early part of his career pursuing his ambition as a singer and composer, Tom started out playing the piano in summer resorts in New England. He eventually gained national prominence with appearances on The Tonight Show, a major recording contract and a steady stream of gigs in Las Vegas and resorts around the country. Although music was his primary focus, Tom's limitless energy and ambition would combine to lead him into a series of successes in the entertainment industry.In 1975, Tom's autobiography, 'If You Could See What I Hear', co-written with Derek Gill, took him on yet another journey, this time as an author. The story is an inspirational one of Tom's college years at Providence College and then at Harvard. Ultimately, it is a true love story about his romance and marriage to his wife, Patty, and the beginning of a family that is to this day the most cherished part of his life. 'If You Could See What I Hear' became a major motion picture in 1982.Tom has gone on to write more than a dozen books, both works of fiction and non-fiction. In 2007's 'Adventures in Darkness', Tom takes readers through his monumental eleventh summer. The story is an inspirational one of Tom's childhood in Boston. This book is a hair-raising, heart-warming experience that culminates in Tom's determination to realize his dreams of a ""normal"" life.Tom was a regular morning fixture to millions as special correspondent for ABC's Good Morning America. He also went on to be nominated for two Emmy Awards and has acted on TV series, such as Designing Women, Highway to Heaven, Fame, M*A*S*H, Mork & Mindy and WKRP in Cincinnati, just to name a few. But to create the characters and fulfill the role of a blind man on prime time he also helped write and develop many of these stories.Thanks to Tom's public life, he has been privileged to become one of America's most sought-after motivational speakers, communicating with over 3,000 corporations around the world.","March 27, 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA",1947-03-27,"Boston, Massachusetts, USA",,,,,Patricia Steffen  (17 May 1969 - present) (2 children),1,0,1,2
nm0837959,Barry Sullivan,Patrick Barry Sullivan,188,"Patrick Barry Sullivan was born on August 29, 1912 in New York City. While never a major movie star, he established himself as a well-known and highly regarded character lead and second lead in motion pictures and television in a career that lasted 50 years. Legend has it that Sullivan was counseled to consider a life in the theater due to his height (6'3"") and good looks. He was supporting himself as a theater usher and department store employee when made his Broadway debut in ""I Want a Policeman"" at the Lyceum Theatre in January 1936. Unfortunately, the show lasted only 47 performances.In 1936, he appeared in three other plays on the Great White Way, the drama ""St. Helena"" and the comedies ""All That Glitters"" and ""Eye On the Sparrow."" All three were flops. Sullivan finally appeared in a hit play when he transferred into the role of Bert Jefferson in Il signore resta a pranzo (1942) by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman. However the 1941-42 season brought three more flops: ""Mr. Big"", ""Ring Around Elizabeth"", and ""Johnny 2 X 4"". Wisely, he stayed away from Broadway for a decade, when he again transferred into a hit, ""The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,"" taking over the role of Barney Greenwald from Henry Fonda. Sullivan was nominated for a Best Actor Emmy Award in 1955 when he reprised the role on Ford Star Jubilee: The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial (1955). His last appearance on Broadway, in the original ""Too Late the Phalarope"" in 1956, was, true to his performance record, a flop. Barry Sullivan's talent was meant for the screen.In the late 1930s, he gained movie acting experience in two-reel comedies produced by the Manhattan-based Educational Studios. After giving up on his Broadway career and moving to Hollywood, Sullivan appeared in an uncredited bit part in ""The Green Hornet Strikes Again! (1940) (1941) at Universal before making his official film debut in the Chester Morris B-picture High Explosive (1943) (1943) at Paramount. His next picture was La donna della città (1943), which was released by United Artists that same year.Barry Sullivan never broke through to become a major star -- but he did establish himself firmly in character lead and second lead roles. He excelled at roles in which he could play aggressive characters that highlighted his centered masculinity. His most notable roles in the early part of his movie career were as the eponymous Violenza (1947), Tom Buchanan in the Alan Ladd version of Il grande Gatsby (1949) (second lead), and as the movie director in Il bruto e la bella (1952) as part of a first rate ensemble. He had his own TV series Harbormaster (1957) in 1957-58 and The Tall Man (1960) in 1960-62. A decade later, his acting skills were used to fine effect in two prestigious productions of stage plays as George C. Scott's brother in the Emmy Award-winning TV adaptation of Arthur Miller's The Price (1971) and the amoral patriarch in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest (1972). He continued acting in movies until 1977, rounding off a near 40-year movie career with an appearance in Bentornato Dio! (1977). He continued to appear periodically on television until retiring in 1980.Sullivan was married three times and fathered three children, Johnny and Jenny Sullivan by his first wife, and Patsy Sullivan-Webb by his second wife Gita Hall. The Sullivan talent has run into three generations. Jenny Sullivan became an actress and a playwright, writing the drama ""J for J"" (""Journal for John"") based on the correspondence between her father and her brother, who was mentally disabled. She was married to the rock star Jim Messina.Patsy Sullivan-Webb was a successful model who appeared as the face of Yardley Cosmetics in the Swinging '60s, starting at the age of twelve. She appeared with her father in the episode of Quella strana ragazza (1966) that opened the series' third season and was a contestant on The Dating Game (1965). She married the great songwriter Jimmy Webb, by whom she had six children. Two of her sons formed the rock group The Webb Brothers.Barry Sullivan died of a respiratory ailment on June 6, 1994 in Sherman Oaks, California.

nm0838047,Ed Sullivan,Edward Vincent Sullivan,175,"The beloved graven image of TV variety from 1948 to 1971 on CBS, Ed Sullivan originally made his name as a newspaper sportswriter, radio broadcaster and theater columnist for the New York Daily News. His column focused primarily on Broadway shows and juicy items about its stars. On the new medium of TV, however, he became a pioneer master of ceremonies and entertainment showman.Edward Vincent Sullivan and his twin brother, Daniel (who died at age 2), were born to a modest Irish musical family on September 28, 1901, in Harlem. A major athlete at Port Chester High School, he lettered in track, football, basketball and baseball. His first professional experience was his local The Port Chester Daily Item, a local newspaper for which he had written sports news while in high school. He joined the paper full-time after graduation. He would land subsequent jobs as a sports reporter, and then various news-related jobs with such papers as The Associated Press, The Philadelphia Bulletin and The New York Bulletin. A sport writer and (later) editor for The Evening Graphic in 1927, Sullivan took over the Broadway column for The News after Walter Winchell left. That position would last 42 years.Hired in 1932 by the CBS network as a rival of radio commentator Walter Winchell, future radio stars introduced on Sullivan's program included Jack Benny. Sullivan made his film debut as himself in Mr. Broadway (1933), which he also wrote. His subsequent screenplay and story involvements included the screwy comedy L'amore bussa tre volte (1938) and the Universal musical Ma! He's Making Eyes at Me (1940).So successful was he on radio that CBS hired him to do Toast of the Town (1948) (""Toast of the Town"") just as TV sets were becoming a home staple. The show, which balanced amazing novelty acts with singing and comedy talents, both legendary and up-and-coming, was broadcast from CBS Studio 50 on Broadway in New York City. In 1967 the studio was aptly renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater. Although Sullivan himself had zilch stage or camera presence and had a frustrating habit of forgetting performers' names as he was about to present them, audiences were completely taken by his charming idiosyncrasies and mellow, almost funereal approach. He and the show became a resounding success for a staggering 23 years.Sullivan had a knack for identifying talent and his Sunday night variety platform became a springboard for a number of top stars and groups, including comics Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis and singers Elvis Presley and The Beatles. He also was color blind when it came to talent, generously promoting a number of black crossover acts, such as The Supremes and other Motown artists, when few other TV shows would. Sullivan appeared as himself in such films as Ciao ciao Birdie (1963), Jerry 8 e 3/4 (1964) and Dominique (1966), among others. The irrepressibly stiff, hunch-shouldered emcee was unmercifully parodied by a parade of impressionists over the decades, including Will Jordan, John Byner and David Frye.Following his cancellation in 1971, Sullivan was seen infrequently hosting variety specials. He died in his beloved New York of esophageal cancer in 1974, three years after the cancellation of his series. The father of one daughter, Betty, Sullivan's wife Sylvia (Weinstein) Sullivan, whom he married in 1930, died the year before.","September 28, 1901 in New York City, New York, USA",1901-09-28,"New York City, New York, USA","October 13, 1974 in New York City, New York, USA  (esophageal cancer)",1974-10-13,"New York City, New York, USA  ",esophageal cancer,Sylvia Weinstein  (28 April 1930 - 16 March 1973) (her death) (1 child),1,0,1,1

nm0838360,Susan Sullivan,Susan Michaela Sullivan,171,"Originally groomed for the theater, Sullivan worked at the National Repertory Theatre in Washington D.C. before landing a role in Broadway opposite Dustin Hoffman in ""Jimmy Shine"". Sullivan continued appearing in theater while working on Falcon Crest (1981) in the 1980s. In the 1960s, Susan played ""Lenore Curtin"" on Destini (1964) for four years, a role that gave her much experience in television, and evidently had a lot of fun from what fellow co-stars (especially Nicolas Coster) have testified. Following her role, Sullivan was acting off-Broadway when an agent spotted her and encouraged her to move to Hollywood, signing her to a contract which was conditional upon her doing so. She went on to play a dozen different parts on TV before taking on the role that would win her an Emmy nomination; that of Peter Strauss' lover in the miniseries, Il ricco e il povero (1976). Sullivan then played a gynecologist in two TV movies, Having Babies II (1977) and Having Babies III (1978), which led to a role in the short-run series Having Babies (1978) (aka Julia Farr, M.D.). Sullivan then went on to become a member of the ensemble cast of Nancy, Sonny & Co. (1980). She attained her greatest success during the '80s when she played the often put-upon ""Maggie"" on Falcon Crest (1981). Throughout FC's run, Sullivan remained devoted to the theatre appearing in ""Fifth of July"" at the Mark Taper Forum in L.A. and ""Last Summer"" at Blue Fish Cove in San Francisco. Sullivan decided to leave FC at the start of its final season after seven seasons because she felt ""Maggie was repeating herself"". Sullivan looks back on her days at FC with pride, especially at her gutsy work when her character had a brief bout with alcohol, drawing on her memories of being the child of an alcoholic. After leaving FC, Sullivan continued her charity association with the Blue Cross and ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics). She then got the opportunity to play comedy in a guest stint in Doctor Doctor (1989). Sullivan then recorded two pilot comedies, ""Ruth Harper"" and ""Satellite News"". She then went on to play the recurring character of George Carlin's love interest on his self-titled show. While working on GC, she played Robert Urich's ex-wife in Danielle Steel's La fiamma del desiderio (1994). In 1995, Sullivan returned to drama in ABC's The Monroes (1995) as ""Kathryn Monroe"", wife of political aspirant William Devane. Sullivan relished the role, and despite the show folding soon after, she received rave reviews, being dubbed the season's best actress. She was also singled out in publications as the show's saving grace. Sullivan continues to stay in touch with several Falcon Crest (1981) stars, including David Selby, and is now dating author Connell Cowan whom she has been seeing since 1989. Sullivan has a sister, Brigid, an executive at WGBH-TV in Boston, and a brother, Brendan, a methadone counselor in N.Y.C. Sullivan had no qualms about working as a bunny girl in the Manhattan Playboy Club (""I had been a waitress before and I felt I would rather show my legs and make sixty dollars a night instead of twenty""), where she recited Shakespeare while serving drinks. When she was twenty-three, Sullivan dated Cary Grant. Behind the scenes, stories of Susan indicate she is big on practical jokes and works hard at cracking the cast up. Her co-star on Falcon Crest (1981), David Selby (Richard) has recalled the time Susan went into the bathroom to slip into something more comfortable for her role, and when the passion of the scene reached fever-pitch, she dropped the robe to reveal a body-stocking crammed with bottles, cans and tubes of toothpaste. David and the rest of the crew fell about laughing hysterically. Sullivan has been a spokeswoman for Tylenol for many years, and is proud to be associated with the product (pointing out the fact that she has been able to buy a beach house with the proceeds). Attractive, intelligent and outspoken, Sullivan is a well-grounded and giving actress who brings much insight into whichever role she chooses to play.","November 18, 1942 in New York City, New York, USA",1942-11-18,"New York City, New York, USA",,,,,Connell Cowan  (1991 - present),1,0,0,0

Beginning his career as a New Jersey teenager pumping fake blood for 80's splatter classic The Deadly Spawn (1983), Sullivan moved to Los Angeles where he worked in development at New Line Cinema, co-producing Detroit Rock City (1999).With a directing style ranging from the 'splatstick' nature of the Maniacs franchise to the serious bent of teen thriller Driftwood (2006), Sullivan gained additional notoriety as celebrity director of Vh1's hit series Scream Queens (2008), as well as creator and host of ""Shock N Roll"", his weekly talk and video blog on leading web network Fearnet.Re-joining forces with Detroit Rock City (1999) director Adam Rifkin for the comedy/horror anthology Chillerama (2011), Sullivan contributed the musical segment I Was a Teenage Werebear (2011), followed by the Burt Reynolds starring vehicle Dog Years (2017), on which Sullivan earned an Associate Producer credit.Deeply affected by the 2013 death of his 'spiritual mentor' Ray Manzarek (with whom he was adapting a film version of Manzarek's novel The Poet in Exile), Sullivan took an extended break from the industry (and Los Angeles) to focus on health, friends and family. It was during this time Sullivan created and developed several projects he will produce and direct upon his return to filmmaking in 2020, among them The Beverly Hills Klown Massacre (from his own script commissioned by Tobe Hooper), Queer Fear (a gay-centric horror anthology), and the branded franchise Night Songs[disambiguation needed] (2020), which explores the paranormal romance between a music journalist and a vampiric young rock star featuring songs co-written by Sullivan.","July 2, 1964 in Plainfield, New Jersey, USA",1964-07-02,"Plainfield, New Jersey, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

Throughout the 1990s he scripted and acted in several micro-budget science fiction and horror movies, most notably Twilight of the Dogs (1995) and Hollywood Mortuary (2000), galvanating the delightful script by Ron Ford as actor-turned-zombie Pratt Borokov, a thinly disguised Boris Karloff.In 2000, Sullivan left Hollywood for South Florida.

Like many within the minority Shanghai expatriate community residing in Hong Kong during the days of the crown colony, Lydia's versatility landed her supporting roles throughout her vast public career in both Cantonese and Mandarin dialect film and television often times playing pillow-talk girlfriends, classmates, sidekicks, siblings, handmaidens, chorus girls, bridesmaids and of course visual comic foil for literally the entire cavalcade of Hong Kong's Golden Age leading ladies including Connie Chan, Li Hua Li, Bo-Bo Fung, Heung Kam Lee, Lily Ho, Meg Lam, Lin-Lin Li, Josephine Siao, Nancy Sit, Ming-Chuen Wang and Tina Ti before later graduating to TV award/variety show MCs and serials roles while still maintaining her staple of mostly big-screen Cantonese parts playing nosy landladies, pampered heiresses, neurotic matrons and doting mothers alongside Carol 'Do Do' Cheng, Maggie Cheung, Sylvia Chang Vivian Chow, Man Cheung, Cora Miao Sandra Kwan Yue Ng, Teresa Mo, Anita Mui and Anita Yuen (not to mention Lydia being their fourth wind slot for their Mahjong games after work) during the high-profile commercial success of the Hong Kong New Wave output through the 1990s.

nm0838595,Donna Summer,LaDonna Adrian Gaines,170,"Donna Summer rocketed to international super-stardom in the mid-1970s when her groundbreaking merger of R&B, soul, pop, funk, rock, disco and avant-garde electronica catapulted underground dance music out of the clubs of Europe to the pinnacles of sales and radio charts around the world. Maintaining an unbroken string of hits throughout the 70s and 80s, most of which she wrote, Donna holds the record for most consecutive double albums to hit #1 on the Billboard charts (3) and first female to have four #1 singles in a 12 month period; 3 as a solo artist and one as a duo with Barbra Streisand. A five-time Grammy winner, Donna Summer was the first artist to win the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female (1979, ""Hot Stuff"") as well as the first-ever recipient of the Grammy for Best Dance Recording (1997, ""Carry On""). In 2004, she became one of the first inductees, as both an Artist Inductee and a Record Inductee (for 1977's ""I Feel Love"") into the Dance Music Hall of Fame in New York City. Born Donna Gaines on New Year's Eve to a large family in Boston, she developed an early interest in music. From the age of eight, Summer sang in church choirs and city-wide choruses, and by her early twenties, was performing in musical theatre in Germany, winning parts in such highly-acclaimed shows as ""Hair,"" ""Showboat,"" ""Godspell,"" and ""Porgy and Bess"" as well as performing with the Viennese Folk Opera. She released her first single, a cover of the Jaynett's girl group classic, ""Sally Go Round The Roses,"" in 1971. While singing backup, she met producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte who produced her first single, ""Hostage,"" which became a hit in the Netherlands, France and Belgium. In 1975, Moroder and Bellotte produced the international hit, ""Love to Love You Baby,"" which rose to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and triggered Summer's triumphant return to the United States as a key figure of the then-emerging disco genre. ""Love To Love You Baby"" paved the way for such international hits as ""MacArthur Park,"" ""Bad Girls,"" ""Hot Stuff,"" ""Dim All The Lights,"" ""On The Radio,"" and ""Enough Is Enough,"" as well as the Grammy and Academy award winning theme song ""Last Dance,"" from the film ""Thank God It's Friday,"" which remains a milestone in Donna's career. In 1980, Summer became the first artist to sign with David Geffen's new label, Geffen Records, leaving her disco days behind and moving into the next phase of her career ."" In the years that followed, Summer collaborated with writers and producers such as Quincy Jones, Michael Omartian and England's dance-pop production compound Stock Aitken Waterman and produced a steady stream of hits from ""State of Independence,"" featuring Michael Jackson on backing vocals, to the abiding feminist anthem ""She Works Hard For The Money,"" one of the most-played songs of all-time, and the infectious ""This Time I Know It's For Real."" In 1994, she released ""Endless Summer,"" a greatest hits retrospective containing a new song, ""Melody of Love,"" which became Billboard's #1 Dance Record of the Year. She also released the critically acclaimed gem ""Christmas Spirit,"" a collection of Summer's original songs and holiday standards recorded with the Nashville Symphony Orchestra. Summer spent the '90s continuing to tour, performing to sold-out audiences worldwide. In 1997, when the new ""Best Dance Recording"" Category was created at the Grammy Awards, Donna Summer was the first winner with her fifth career Grammy award for ""Carry On."" In 1999, Sony/Epic Records released ""VH1 Presents Donna Summer: Live & More - Encore!,"" an album and DVD of Summer's critically acclaimed VH1 broadcast taped at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom. The show premiered on VH1 as one of the network's highest rated shows to date and featured live performances of Summer's top hits. In addition to her five Grammy Awards, Summer has won six American Music Awards, three consecutive #1 platinum double albums (she's the only solo artist, male or female, ever to accomplish this), 11 gold albums, four #1 singles on Billboard's Hot 100 Chart, 3 platinum singles, and 12 gold singles. Summer is also the first female artist to have a #1 single and #1 album on the Billboard charts simultaneously (""Live & More;"" ""MacArthur Park"" 1978) a feat she also repeated six months later (""Bad Girls"" & ""Hot Stuff"" in 1979). She has charted 33 Top Ten hits on the combined Billboard Disco/Dance/Dance Club/Play charts over a period of 37 years with 18 reaching the #1 spot solidifying her as the undisputed Queen of Dance. In addition to her recording and performing career, Summer is an accomplished visual artist whose work has been shown at exhibitions worldwide including Steven Spielberg's ""Starbright Foundation Tour of Japan"" and The Whitney Museum as well as a prestigious engagement at Sotheby's in New York. Since 1989, she has sold over 1.7 million dollars in original art - with her highest piece going for $150,000. In 2003, Random House published her autobiography ""Ordinary Girl,"" co-authored with Marc Eliot. Also that year, Universal released ""The Journey,"" containing all of her original hits, as well as two new songs. In 2008, celebrating four decades of milestones, Summer adds another accomplishment to her list with the success of her new album ""Crayons."" The album debuted at #17 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart making it Summer's highest debuting album ever. It also debuted at #5 on the Billboard R&B chart - another personal best. ""Crayons"" is Summer's first album of all new studio material in 17 years and is her highest charting album since ""She Works Hard For The Money"" in 1983. To date, the album has spawned three #1 Dance hits ""I'm A Fire,"" ""Stamp Your Feet"" and ""Fame (The Game)."" It is estimated that Summer has sold more than 130 million records worldwide. Ranked #24 on Billboard Magazines 50th Anniversary issue's ""Hot 100 Artists of All Time,"" Donna Summer was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame on April 18, 2013 in Los Angeles.

The hard-looking, blue-eyed blonde began in films in 1947 but created some waves first on stage opposite Cicely Courtneidge in ""Her Excellency"" at the London Hippodrome in 1949. She followed that with a top role in a rather mediocre musical entitled ""Golden City."" Musicals would be a strong suit for her in the ensuing years including a more glamorous role in ""When in Rome"" (1959) alongside June Laverick. Eleanor made her last West End musical in 1974 in a show based on the cartoon character of Osbert Lancaster. A popular radio actress and a regular on BBC Radio Four panel show ""Many a Slip,"" she positively shined on TV in a number of comedy series as she entered her matronly years. She had the difficult task of replacing Dora Bryan in the established program ""Our Dora"" when Ms. Bryan abruptly left the series after the sudden death of her first child. Now retitled My Wife's Sister (1956), the show, and Eleanor, succeeded quite well. During her five-decade career, she added bite to a number of films, often raucous comedies, including Risate in paradiso (1951), Isn't Life Wonderful! (1953), Dentist in the Chair (1960), A 077, dalla Francia senza amore (1961) and Some Will, Some Won't (1970), which was a remake of the earlier film Risate in paradiso (1951). Long married to actor Leonard Sachs in 1947, they produced two sons; one son, Robin Sachs, became an actor in his own right.

nm0838843,Slim Summerville,George Joseph Somerville,189,"Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1892, rustic-looking George ""Slim"" Summerville possessed one of those malleable mugs that made you laugh even before he opened his mouth. Young Slim ran away from home as a youth and lived a rather wanderlust life until a chance meeting with Mack Sennett through his comedian friend Edgar Kennedy changed everything. He broke into silent films at age nineteen as one of Sennett's pie-hurling Keystone Kops and became part of the stock company of players. Making an unbilled appearance in Keystone's first feature film Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914), Summerville's gangly build and naive innocence, not to mention his potato-like nose, mournful mug, and slim, curling upper lip, helped set him apart -- so much so that Summerville eventually branched out into his own short vehicles. Much more comfortable in rumpled clothes and overalls than a suit and tie, he later learned the ropes of directing and in the 1920s helmed a string of short films for both Fox and Universal studios. He refocused on acting come the advent of sound and made a rather easy transition, standing out in a number of commercial films, both comedic and dramatic, including the mammoth war epic All'ovest niente di nuovo (1930), the landmark musical film Il re del jazz (1930), Hecht-MacArthur's classic The Front Page (1931), the Shirley Temple vehicles Capitan Gennaio (1936) and Rondine senza nido (1938), and John Ford's La via del tabacco (1941). In addition he scored in a series of short comedies opposite Zasu Pitts, and a slew of supports in Hoot Gibson westerns. Usually playing much older than he was, the sleepy-eyed, slow-drawling Summerville played his last role in The Hoodlum Saint (1946), before dying of a stroke on January 5, 1946, at the not-so-old age of 53. He left a strong enough legacy, however, to be remembered as one of the screen's more reliable comedians. He was survived by his wife Eleanor and son Elliot.","July 10, 1892 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA",1892-07-10,"Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","January 6, 1946 in Laguna Beach, California, USA  (stroke)",1946-01-06,"Laguna Beach, California, USA  ",stroke,"Eleanor Brown  (1937 - 5 January 1946) (his death)

As various desk clerks, waiters and menservants (and maybe a couple of out-of-character villains), he seemed to back up a large roster of MGM's biggest stars in musicals (he himself didn't sing) including June Allyson in Good News (1947), Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in I barkleys di Broadway (1949) and Betty Hutton in Anna prendi il fucile (1950), to name a few. Of these, he may be best remembered as Judy Garland's benevolent bartender in Ti amavo senza saperlo (1948). Other more prominent parts came as a snippy butler in The Girl Next Door (1953) and private eye J. Scott Smart's ""Man Friday"" in the Universal mystery programmer Storia d'un detective (1951). A Broadway veteran, Sundberg's better known stage roles were as Mortimer in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and Mr. Kraler in ""The Diary of Anne Frank."" TV allowed him to be a bit more assertive in personality while also showing his intelligent side as assorted doctor and professor types.

nm0839213,Gerry Sundquist,Gerald Christopher Sundquist,175,"Actor Gerry Sundquist was born Gerald Christopher Sundquist in Manchester. He was known professionally as Gerry Sundquist, but always affectionately known as Ged to his friends.He grew up in Chorlton with his older brother and younger sister. He developed an interest in acting at primary school and joined the Stretford Children's Theatre whilst still at school - St. Augustine's R.C. Grammar School in Wythenshawe.On leaving school at 16 he worked briefly on the night shift at the Kellogg's factory in Manchester, but keen to pursue his acting career he soon moved to London. His first real breakthrough came in 1974 when he was cast in his first professional TV role as Jim in the popular 10-part Granada TV serial 'Soldier & Me' followed by the role of Billy in 'The Siege of Golden Hill' in 1975. He also appeared in many theatre productions in the mid 1970s - the Young Vic's production of 'All Walk of Leg', 'The Fantastic Fairground' and 'Macbeth' in 1975, following on with a memorable portrayal of Alan Strang in John Dexter's production of 'Equus' at the National Theatre in 1976.His other TV and film roles include an appearance as Malic in 'The Dorcons' episode of 'Space 1999', in 1978, the starring role in 'Music Machine' in 1979, Michael Radlet in the TV drama, 'The Mallens' in 1980 and one of his finest roles, 'Pip' in the 1981 BBC adaption of 'Great Expectations'. Appearances in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' in 1982 and 'The Last Days of Pompeii' and 'Don't Open 'til Christmas' in 1984, followed.In between filming in various locations around the world, Gerry lived in the Cotswolds village of Barnsley for a time and then moved back to London. However, his personal life and career seemed to go into a downward spiral in the mid 1980s.Throughout his most difficult times he was supported by his loving family, especially his brother Geoffrey and with his help Gerry seemed to gradually overcome his problems and resume his acting career. In 1992 he played a character called Jimmy Matthews in 'Lost Boy' - an episode of the long running ITV series, 'The Bill' but this was Gerry's last TV appearance. Despite his apparent hope for the future, Gerry took his own life by jumping in front of a train at Norbiton train station on Sunday, 1st August, 1993. He was only 37 years old. He left a suicide note apologising to his family for ""letting you down"". His funeral took place in Kingston, Surrey.Gerry's brother, Geoffrey was inspired to create a lasting tribute to Gerry's life and created a children's story - 'Father Christmas and the Missing Reindeer', inspired by childhood memories of time spent with Gerry and their family at Christmas time. The book was published and later made into an animated short film and released in 1997 - dedicated to Gerry's memory.After his first book, Geoffrey began writing a screenplay for a film entitled 'The Whistling Boys', a story about two brothers, set during the First World War. However, the film was never realised as, sadly, Geoffrey Sundquist passed away in March, 2005.","October 6, 1955 in Manchester, England, UK",1955-10-06,"Manchester, England, UK","August 1, 1993 in Norbiton Train Station, London, England, UK  (suicide)",1993-08-01,"Norbiton Train Station, London, England, UK  ",suicide,,0,0,0,0

His breakthrough performance as a young football player in Disney's Il sapore della vittoria - Uniti si vince (2000) with Denzel Washington garnered him critical acclaim and led to another role opposite Washington in director Nick Cassavetes' thriller, John Q (2002).Born in New York and raised in Los Angeles, Suplee is the son of actors Deborah Deeble and Bill Suplee. He landed his first role, at the age of 16, on the popular television series, Crescere che fatica (1993). He had a recurring role as the reluctant bully ""Frankie"" for three seasons.

Smith went on to cast Suplee in In cerca di Amy (1997) and as the voice of ""Norman the Golgothan"" in Dogma (1999). More recent comedy credits include ""Without A Paddle"" with Seth Green and Matthew Lillard, director Todd Phillips Road Trip (2000) and Evolution (2001) for director Ivan Reitman.Suplee showcased his impressive acting chops with a powerful and compelling performance in 1998 in director Tony Kaye's ""American History X"". He played a carelessly violent racist skinhead who tries to convince his friend (Edward Norton) to ""come back to his roots"" in their gang of white supremacists.His role of high school football lineman ""Louie"" in Disney's ""Remember the Titans"" exposed Suplee to a larger audience, and he was singled out by many critics as a fresh and welcome screen presence, with the Hollywood Reporter calling his performance ""scene-stealing.""With Ted Demme's 1970s drug-cartel drama ""Blow,"" Suplee continued to raise his profile, playing ""Tuna"", the best friend of Johnny Depp's newly turned drug dealer ""George Jung"".More recently, Suplee played a pivotal role of a young soldier in Miramax and Anthony Minghella's period piece ""Cold Mountain,"" with Jude Law and Nicole Kidman.

Until 1930 he wrote almost 90 scripts for this company and gained an enormous reputation, but that year he decided to write and direct his own films without Bando. He debuted as a director for the Emperor Kine Company (later Shinko Cinema) in 1930 with ""The Strange Story of Mito Komon"". But none of the 40 films he directed till 1954 were worthwhile. The next year he stopped writing films. Susukita, who during his career used four different pen names, was also creator of the character of Murasaki Zukin, also known as ""The Black Hood"" or ""The Purple Hood"" (lit.); which has been converted into film half a dozen of times. The first film Susukita wrote was ""Murasaki Zukin: Ukiyo Eshi"" (""The Woodcut Artist""), and was directed by Shozo Makino and Bansho Kanamori in 1923. Susukita himself directed one remake in 1931. Chiezo Kataoka played Murasaki in 1958. But the most famous version was made after the death of its author: Ryutaro Otomo played the Black Hood in 1963, directed by Ei'ichi Kudo and adapted by Tai Kato.","1899 in Kagoshima, Japan","1899 in Kagoshima, Japan","Kagoshima, Japan",1960,1960,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0840330,John Sutton,John Sutton,188,"Of British parentage, John Sutton was born in Rawalpindi, India (now part of Pakistan), on October 22, 1908. After graduating from Wellington College, he spent a decade or so working in various British colonies, including several in Africa, as a hunter, rancher and tea plantation manager. An avid wanderlust adventurer in the same vein as Errol Flynn (with whom he worked in La leggenda di Robin Hood (1938)) during his pre-Hollywood days, Sutton lived all over the world, including China, Malaya and the Philippines. He somehow arrived in Hollywood in the mid-'30s as a technical consultant on films with a British Empire background. He was a dark, handsome man and, eventually, this caught directors' eyes and he was placed in front of the camera. Making an unbilled debut in Il re dei pellirosse (1936), he apprenticed in a number of bit roles for a couple of years, including a minor running part in the ""Bulldog Drummond"" series from 1937-1939. Unlike Flynn, however, this slick-looking actor had more slivery eyes to match his slivery mustache and a shadier countenance. For most of his career he would find himself more on the cruel end of a romantic triangle. As the ""other man"" or hero's adversary, he was shown at his best as flashy, slimy swashbucklers who met their fate at the end of the sword in the final reel. He peaked in the 1940s at 20th Century-Fox, where he carved out quite a nasty niche for himself in such films as La baia di Hudson (1941), La porta proibita (1943), Il capitano di Castiglia (1947), Capitano Casanova (1948), I tre moschettieri (1948), La maschera dei Borgia (1949) and Il ventaglio (1949).

Although it wasn't meant to be, Janet Suzman has remained one of the more respected classical stage actresses of her time. Born in 1939, she was raised in a staunch, liberal family household in South Africa at a time when the country was confronted with the horrors of apartheid. Janet studied languages at the multi-racial Witwatersrand University in the late 1950s and was an active member of the drama society. She left South Africa during the height of her country's oppression and moved to England in 1959.Making her professional stage debut with ""Billy Liar"" in 1962, she almost immediately joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and received rave notices for her Joan of Arc in ""The War of the Roses."" She made her official London debut in a production of ""A Comedy of Errors"" in 1963. In the ensuing years Janet built up an impressive classical resumé portraying most of Shakespeare's illustrious heroines including Rosalind, Portia, Ophelia, Beatrice and the shrewish Kate. She also appeared in several BBC-TV versions of the classics.In 1969 Janet married director Trevor Nunn and together they collaborated on some of England's finest stage productions during the early 1970s, notably ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (1972), ""Titus Andronicus"" (1972) and ""Hello and Goodbye"" (1973), which won Janet the Evening Standard award. She won a second for her role of Masha in the 1976 production of Chekhov's ""The Three Sisters."" They had a son, Joshua, before they divorced in the 1980s. Later work included notable roles in ""She Stoops to Conquer,"" ""The Good Woman of Setzuan"" and her ""Hedda Gabler.""In the early 1970s Janet branched out into films and, following an auspicious turn in A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (1972), won the coveted role of Czarina Alexandra in the florid historical piece Nicola e Alessandra (1971) co-starring Michael Jayston. With a sterling British cast in support, including Harry Andrews, Jack Hawkins, Ian Holm, John McEnery, Laurence Olivier and Michael Redgrave. Janet received an Oscar nomination for her performance and bigger things seemed inevitable. She went on to grace a number of films including La nave dei dannati (1976), Nijinsky (1980) and Priest of Love (1981).In a reprise of her real life family's activism, Suzman co-starred in the anti-apartheid film Un'arida stagione bianca (1989) portraying the wife of the Donald Sutherland character. The cast included other progressive activists such as Susan Sarandon and Marlon Brando (who received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor). In a change-of-pace role, she played a Mother Superior in the hysterical farce Suore in fuga (1990).In the 1980s Janet was inspired to direct and coach. She was a visiting professor of drama at Westfield College, London, and later returned to South Africa to provide multi-ethnic castings in versions of Shakespearean plays. Making her directing bow in a production of ""Othello"" at the Market Theatre in 1987, some of her more notable assignments included ""Death of a Salesman (1992) and a reworked politicized version of Chekhov's ""The Cherry Orchard"" called ""The Free State"" (1997), which is set in South Africa. In 2002 Janet returned to the RSC to perform in ""The Hollow Crown,"" and most recently appeared in a London production of ""Whose Life Is It Anyway?"" (2005) starring Kim Cattrall.Into the millennium, other than a couple of films such as Max (2002) and Felix (2013), Janet appeared primarily on the smaller screen in such TV series as Tinga Tinga Tales (2010) (as the voice of the Ostrich) and Sinbad (2012), and a role in the mini-series Labyrinth (2012)","February 9, 1939 in Johannesburg, South Africa",1939-02-09,"Johannesburg, South Africa",,,,,Trevor Nunn  (18 October 1969 - 18 April 1986) (divorced) (1 child),1,1,1,1

After struggling for a few years, he was finally given a major opportunity: to walk on the runway for Paris Collection. During the fashion week, he ran around the city auditioning for as many international fashion brands as possible. However, at the end of fashion week, the Gulf War broke out and everyone was immediately sent home. With no prospect of working internationally, Kazuma was devastated. 6 months later, a miracle occurred. The international fashion icon Benetton offered him to be the first Japanese person to model for the international campaign. Given an opportunity to restart his international career, he flew back to Paris for the photo shoot. Kazuma was featured on posters all around the world including Times Square, giving him international recognition.

He wanted to study acting seriously and dedicate his life to it. Kazuma took matters into his own hands and knocked on the door of Yoko Narahashi, the most respected method acting coach in Japan. Kazuma's cutting-edge acting skills were soon recognized by Yukio Ninagawa, the world renowned Shakespearean director. Mr. Ninagawa cast Kazuma as Ferdinand in his critically acclaimed production of The Tempest.Since then, he won Best Supporting Actor for his memorable performance in the film Orokamono.

The long sought gate to Hollywood finally opened for him. Once he had moved to the U.S., he immediately started to audition for major projects, fulfilling his dream of working in both Japan and Hollywood.","October 8, 1968 in Shizuoka, Japan",1968-10-08,"Shizuoka, Japan",,,,,?

Her film debut was as an extra in The Fable of Elvira and Farina and the Meal Ticket (1915). From the following year on, she had leading roles in pictures for Keystone, then a year with Triangle, and, in 1919, a contract with Cecil B. DeMille. DeMille transformed her from a typical Mack Sennett comedienne into a lively, provocative, even predatory, star. She collected husbands (e.g., the indigent Henri de la Falaise) and lovers (e.g., Joseph P. Kennedy, father of President John F. Kennedy). Kennedy produced her La regina Kelly (1932), directed by Erich von Stroheim (it was von Stroheim's copy of this film that Swanson was watching as Norma Desmond in Viale del tramonto (1950) when she leaped into the projection beam shouting, ""Have they forgotten what a star looks like? I'll be up there again, so help me!""--ironic in that the butler-projectionist was, again, von Stroheim). She survived the switch to talkies, even learning how to sing for Musica nell'aria (1934), but her kinds of films were over with by that time. She returned to the stage in the 1940s (""Reflected Glory,"" ""Let us Be Gay,"" ""A Goose for a Gander""). She was a clothes designer and artist; she founded Essence of Nature Cosmetics; and she made television appearances through the 1960s and 1970s, doing cameos and pushing health foods.

With a PhD. in Victorian literature, as well as Master's and B.A. degrees in English from the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, Dr. Swarthout knew almost too much about the great works of fiction and their authors, and was constantly trying to top them, never writing sequels to any of his hit novels or a series of books based on his lead characters. Glendon later admitted this was possibly a mistake, for critics and fans never knew what might come out of his typewriter next, although editors tried to get him to write a Where The Girls Are or a series of Shootist Westerns many times. Still, Glendon won many writing awards for his stories and quite a few of them were also eventually made into interesting motion pictures, including the film hits Where The Boys Are (MGM,1960) and The Shootist (Paramount, 1976), as well as less successful films, Seventh Cavalry (Columbia, 1956), They Came To Cordura (Columbia, 1959), and Bless the Beasts & Children (Columbia, 1972).

nm0842140,Julia Sweeney,Julia Anne Sweeney,163,"Benevolent, sweet-faced, actress and comedienne Julia (Anne) Sweeney, who was born on October 10, 1959 in Spokane, Washington, is normally identified with one single, highly unappetizing androgynous character. This sniveling, chunky-framed, springy-haired, plaid shirt-wearing, grotesque-looking character named Pat was the basis of many hilarious sketches that toyed with revealing his/her true gender.Julia, the oldest of five children born to an Irish-Catholic federal prosecutor, demonstrated an early talent for mimicry but downplayed any interest in performing for serious college studies. With a prep school education, she first came into contact with the show business arena following graduation. Behind the scenes she worked for five years as an accountant for Columbia Studios in Los Angeles.Finally developing the courage to realize her dream, she started taking classes on a whim at the famed Groundlings Theater. After fine-tuning her skills in improv, character development and sketch-writing, Julia was escalated to the big time appearing on such TV shows as ""Brothers,"" ""Hard Time on Planet Earth"" and ""Not Necessarily the News, she hit an early peak when she was selected to join Il Saturday Night Live (1975) in 1990 as a featured player.Though she became a regular cast member the following season and found an instant audience rapport with her creepy Pat character, the comic gifts were vastly underused, which seemed to be the case for many of its distaff team at the time. ""Pat"" would outshine practically everything else she did on the show, including her timid wallflower type named ""Mea Culpa,"" whose character became the basis of a stage show co-written by Julia and actor/writer/husband Stephen Hibbert called ""Mea's Big Apology"" in 1992. During her SNL stay, she managed some outside work with small roles in the comedy Tesoro, mi si è allargato il ragazzino (1992) the SNL related feature film Teste di cono (1993) and the drama Pulp Fiction (1994).Highly discouraged, Julia parted ways with SNL in 1994 and worked up a feature film version of It's Pat: The Movie (1994) while her irons in the fire were hot. She co-wrote the script with Hibbert and co-starred with Dave Foley who played Pat's equally androgynous partner ""Chris."" The feature film did not generate great buzz, however, as it was basically a one-joke premise stretched to the limit.Life turned extremely dark for Julia at this point. Divorced from Hibbert, brother Michael developed lymphoma. She and her family vainly tried to nurse him back to health. Following his death, Julia herself was forced to fight a life-threatening illness -- cervical cancer. The whole process triggered an outpouring of writing which evolved into a hit one-woman stage show entitled, ""God Said, Ha!"" Applauded for its candor, wit and humorous handling of such painful subjects, the monologue debuted in San Francisco in 1995, and was playing Broadway by November of the following year.Eventually Julia contributed a few character cameos in such films as Stuart salva la famiglia (1995) starring SNL alumni Al Franken; the Rodney Dangerfield slapstick vehicle Piacere, Wally Sparks (1997); and former SNL Chevy Chase's lampoon entry Las Vegas - Una vacanza al casinò (1997). Preserving her applauded stage work on film, she wrote and directed God Said, 'Ha!' (1998), with Quentin Tarantino in the producer's chair. While embracing this second career-defining moment, Julia won an Audience Award at the New York Comedy Festival in 1998 for her efforts, and earned a Grammy nomination for the CD version.Following work on such popular TV sitcoms as ""Hope and Gloria,"" ""3rd Rock from the Sun,"" ""George & Leo"" (recurring) and ""Suddenly Susan,"" Julia went on to complete a trilogy of personal sojourns on stage into the millennium. ""In the Family Way"" (2003) recounted her experience adopting a daughter as a single parent, and ""Letting Go of God"" (2004) traced her religious roots from devout Catholic to atheist.Other comedy film roles have included her Mom role as Beth Newton in Beethoven 3 (2000) and Beethoven 4 (2001), Clockstoppers (2002) and a voice in the animated feature Monsters University (2013). On TV, she had another Mom role in the TV high school comedy series Maybe It's Me (2001) and appeared in guest parts in ""According to Jim,"" ""Frasier"" and ""Sex and the City,"" plus recurring roles on Shrill (2019) and Work in Progress (2019).","October 10, 1959 in Spokane, Washington, USA",1959-10-10,"Spokane, Washington, USA",,,,,"Michael Blum  (3 May 2008 - present) (1 child)

She was a dancer by the time she was four and a talented actress by 1909 when she started work at the Biograph with D.W. Griffith. By 1910, aged 14, she was four years younger than Mary Pickford, but her maturity and appearance soon lead to leading roles. She starred in such films as The Lonedale Operator (1911) and Judith of Bethulia (1914). Unlike most of the frail roles for women of her day, her presence was smart and resourceful. She left Biograph in 1914 and worked with Cecil B. DeMille in The Warrens of Virginia (1915). A popular and independent actress, she worked for many studio's and directors in the age of silent movies.In 1922, she married director Marshall Neilan, who would direct her in Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1924). The marriage ended in divorce in 1929. In 1923, she starred in Anna Christie (1923), directed by John Griffith Wray, the first play by Eugene O'Neill to be filmed. Even before talkies, her career was in decline. She made three talking pictures, including Show Girl in Hollywood (1930). This was to be the last film Sweet appeared in before retiring. Her line, in the movie, about being washed up at 32 in Hollywood, was close to the truth for her. (She was 34.) After that she retired from the screen and returned to the Stage. She appeared in plays on Broadway and with touring companies and also worked in radio during the 1930s. She and co-star Raymond Hackett married in 1936 and remained married until his death in 1958.

nm0842248,Dolph Sweet,Adolphus Jean Sweet,175,"A barrel-chested, bull-necked presence on stage, film and TV, the tough-minded character actor was born Adolphus Jean Sweet in New York City on July 18, 1920, the son of an auto mechanic. He initially attended the University of Alabama in 1939, but his studies were interrupted by WWII Air Force duty. As a navigator of B-24s, he was shot down during a raid and captured, spending two years as a POW in Germany. For his valor he was honored with the Distinguished Flying Cross and The Purple Heart.A semi-pro football player and a boxer at one point, he received his Masters from Columbia University in 1949 at age 29. He subsequently became the head of the drama division of the English Department at Barnard College from 1949 to 1961. During this period of time he studied voice with Peyton Hibbett, took intensive acting classes with Tamara Daykarhanova and Joseph Anthony at the Daykarhanova School for the Stage in New York City, and appeared in random stock productions in the hopes of one day pursuing a professional career full-time.The 40-something-year-old Sweet finally made his New York/Broadway debut in the Zero Mostel starrer ""Rhinoceros"" in 1961, and continued on the Great White Way with outstanding parts in ""Romulus"" (1962), ""The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window in 1964 (and its 1972 revival) and ""Streamers"" in 1976. Making his TV debut with ""The Defenders"" in 1961, Dolph quickly became a veteran of blue-collar cop shows including ""East Side, West Side"" and ""The Trials of O'Brien."" In the late 1960s he started making a dent in soap operas with regular roles on Dark Shadows (1966), Ai confini della notte (1956), Somerset (1970) and especially Destini (1964), where he remained for five seasons (1972-1977) playing (of course) Police Chief Gil McGowan, the second husband of Constance Ford's beloved Ada Davis character.Dolph received rather scant notice for his film roles despite some good scenes in such movies as Gli ultimi sei minuti (1972) and Vittorie perdute (1978). TV proved to be a more accepting medium for the actor. He portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the ""King"" miniseries in 1978 and in the early 1980s the portly character player won a change-of-pace comedy lead in the popular sitcom La piccola grande Nell (1981) in which he played (naturally) a police chief, Carl Kanisky, a widower whose household was run by the irrepressible Nell Carter.During the show's run, Dolph was stricken with cancer and would die on May 8, 1985. At the beginning of the 1985-1986 season, the chief's passing was incorporated into the script and Nell became surrogate mother and father to his children. In real-life, the 64-year-old actor was survived by his second wife of 11 years, actress Iris Braun, and son Jonathan from his first marriage to Reba Gillespie, which ended in divorce in 1973.","July 18, 1920 in New York City, New York, USA",1920-07-18,"New York City, New York, USA","May 8, 1985 in Tarzana, Los Angeles, California, USA  (cancer)",1985-05-08,"Tarzana, Los Angeles, California, USA  ",cancer,"Iris Braun  (5 October 1974 - 8 May 1985) (his death)

As a child, Doug drew cartoons for the Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts for several years. After graduating high school in 1992, Doug opted to attend California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and pursue his lifelong love and passion for animation.In 1994, he decided to leave school in his final year to join Pixar. His first assignment was as an animator on Toy Story. He continued as animator on A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2. He was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Character Animation for Toy Story 2. Doug continued to build an incredible reputation as one of the best animators in the business. He was awarded back to back Annie awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Character Animation for Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo. Doug took on the lead animator role for Bud Luckey's Oscar-nominated Boundin' short and worked as an animator and storyboard artist on the Oscar-winning The Incredibles. Sweetland followed this up by stepping into the supervising animator role on John Lasseter's Cars.In 2007, Doug pitched a short film about a sympathetic magician who gets ""dumped"" by his rabbit. This eventually evolved to a more slapstick film (and a throwback to Warner Bros. classic Looney Tunes). Teddy Newton was brought on board to design the characters; it emerged as Sweetland's directorial debut. Presto was very well received by audiences and critics alike when it preceded WALL-E in theaters. It was honored in 2008 with an Academy Award nomination in the Best Animated Short Film category. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2008. And it is understood that he's gonna release another computer animation in 2014.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0842485,Jo Swerling,Joseph Swerling,175,"Oscar-nominated Hollywood screenwriter Jo Swerling, who also was a Tony Award-winning Broadway writer and lyricist, was born in Berdichev, Ukraine in what was then the Russian Empire. His family emigrated from Czarist Russia and he grew up on the Lower East Side in New York City.From a youthful job peddling newspapers, he worked his way up to becoming a journalist, working on newspapers and magazines in the 1920s, including the prestigious ""Vanity Fair"". He became a playwright, like other famous journalists of the era (most notably Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur of The Front Page (1931) fame). Swerling wrote the stage show ""Street Cinderella"" for the The Marx Brothers and the screenplay for their first film, the 1921 comedy short Humor Risk (1921), starring Chico, Groucho, Harpo and Zeppo. Groucho supposedly hated it so much, he burned the negative. The movie was never released.Swerling's first legitimate production on the Great White Way was the musical-revue ""The New Yorkers"", which ran for a then-respectable 52 performances in March and April 1927. Swerling wrote the book and the lyrics for the songs. His next foray on Broadway was the more successful ""Kibitzer"", an original comedy he co-wrote with Edward G. Robinson (who also co-starred in the show). It ran for 120 performances in February through June 1929.Wall Street famously laid an egg in October 1929, and Swerling would not be back on Broadway for 21 years. Hollywood beckoned.In 1929, Universal adapted his play ""The Understander"" into the movie Melody Lane (1929) while Paramount released The Kibitzer (1930) the following year (without the participation of Edward G. Robinson). Columbia Pictures, the premier studio on Hollywood's ""Poverty Row"", hired Swerling, and his first screen credit was for the screenplay for Frank Capra's Femmine di lusso (1930). He would received screen credit on Capra's next five films in the period 1930-32, before Capra turned to Robert Riskin as his main collaborator. (Jo would work on the screenplay for Capra's classic La vita è meravigliosa (1946), providing additional scenes.)Swerling worked on scores of films before he received his last screen credit for Il padrone di New York (1961) in 1961. He received his sole Oscar nomination for L'idolo delle folle (1942). He was one of the many screenwriters, including Ben Hecht, who worked uncredited on the Oscar-winning Via col vento (1939) screenplay (won by Sidney Howard).Swerling's greatest professional success came when he returned to Broadway, co-writing the book for the classic musical Bulli e pupe (1955) with Abe Burrows, for which he shared the Tony and the New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards for Best Musical. The show was a smash, running from November 1950 to November 1953 for a total of 1,200 performances. The screenplay for the 1955 movie adaptation was written by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, whose brother Herman J. Mankiewicz shared an Oscar nod for Best Screenplay in 1943 with Swerling.Jo Swerling died in Los Angeles, California on October 23, 1964.

nm0842608,Kay Swift,Katharine Faulkner Swift,,"Kay Swift is better known for her decade-long involvement with George Gershwin than she is for her own musical contributions to the American Songbook. After George's death, she was sought after far more as an expert on his work than for her own original musical compositions. Though many people believe that she made this choice, she had a great deal of regret that her career was always second to his, and much as she wished for work, she never had few of the kind of opportunities that would have resulted in a bigger catalog bearing her name. Gershwin dedicated his ""Songbook"" to her. He suggested that her maiden name, Swift, with the nickname ""Kay,"" which originated with him, would be the perfect name for her as a songwriter. Trained as a classical musician, with a great deal of talent both as a performer and as a composer, she only began to write popular show tunes with his encouragement.In 1930, Kay and her husband James Paul Warburg (of the banking Warburgs) wrote the first successful musical show of the 1930s, Fine and Dandy (with a book by Donald Ogden Stewart) starring Joe Cook. (Warburg wrote under the name ""Paul James"" so that his father's banking associates wouldn't become alarmed.) This song was preceded by many revue songs, including ""Can't We Be Friends?"" from the 1929 Schwartz-Dietz revue The Little Show. Her musical and personal relationship with George Gershwin was so significant that her handwritten comments and notation can be found on pages of the original manuscript to Porgy and Bess. For ten years she and George were intimate, and it is certain, after some frustrations in Hollywood, he was about to return to her in New York before his untimely death in 1937. After George's death, she completed many of George's works (from memory) and wrote down complete works that otherwise would have been lost. Her second Broadway score (words and music) was for Cornelia Otis Skinner's one-woman show Paris '90. Even into her 90s, Swift was the last knowledgeable living person who could play Gershwin music the way George played it. Her apartment in Manhattan was the ultimate destination for Gershwin scholars. She was a consultant for the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Let 'Em Eat Cake production in 1983 and also for the recordings of conductor and Gershwin scholar Michael Tilson Thomas.","April 19, 1897 in New York City, New York, USA",1897-04-19,"New York City, New York, USA","January 28, 1993",1993-01-28,,,"Hunter Galloway  (1946 - 1969) (divorced)

Holding her own alongside Marsha Mason and Anthony Hopkins, Susan was able to convey childish innocence in the role of Ivy, and could also turn on the tears in the more intense scenes. The following year, she played Barbara Eden's mousy daughter Dee in the comedy Harper Valley P.T.A. (1978), then took a four year break.

nm0842677,Nora Swinburne,Leonora Mary Johnson,166,"Known for her genteel ways and stately beauty in tea service drama, British actress Nora Swinburne was born Elinore Johnson on July 24, 1902, in Bath, England. Performing on stage as both actress and dancer from the age of 10, her father, Henry Swinburne Johnson, manufactured toys for a living. She was a member of Clive Currie's Young Players in 1914 and appeared in shows during that year. Educated at Rosholme College, she trained for the arts at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Building up her stage reputation with such pieces as ""Suzette"" (1917), ""Yes, Uncle!"" (1918), ""Scandal"" (1919), and the title role in ""Tilly of Bloomsbury"" (1921), her attractiveness proved quite suitable for films, entering silent pictures in 1920. She appeared in a handful of sophisticated fare throughout the early part of the decade such as Branded (1920), The Fortune of Christina McNab (1921), Hornet's Nest (1923), and A Girl of London (1925). Divorced from actor Francis Lister, she was married to actor Edward Ashley at the time she met Esmond Knight while appearing in the play ""Wise Tomorrow"" in 1937. Actually, both actors were married at the time, but they engaged in a long, discreet affair until both were free. They finally married in the late 1940s and enjoyed a long union together. They would appear in several plays over the years from ""Autumn Crocus"" (1939) to ""The Cocktail Party"" (1974). Ms. Swinburne enjoyed great theatrical success playing the role of Dinah Lot in the play ""Lot's Wife"" (1938), which she subsequently reproduced under her own management, and later replaced Diana Wynyard in the memorable war drama ""Watch on the Rhine"" in 1943. By the advent of sound, Ms. Swinburne had been related to opulent supports in films, usually appearing as ladylike mothers or socialite types in plush Gainsborough dramas. Some of her later films would include Perfect Understanding (1933), La cittadella (1938), L'uomo in grigio (1943), Il mio amore vivrà (1944), Jassy la zingara (1947), Cristoforo Colombo (1949), Passioni (1948), Il fiume (1951) (with husband Knight), Quo Vadis (1951) (as Pomponia), Elena di Troia (1956) (as Hecuba), Decisione a mezzanotte (1963) (again with Knight), Interludio (1968) and Anna dei mille giorni (1969). An avid gardener by nature, Ms. Swinburne would die of old age in 2000, thirteen years after husband Knight.","July 24, 1902 in Bath, Somerset, England, UK [now Bath and North East Somerset, England, UK]",1902-07-24,"Bath, Somerset, England, UK [now Bath and North East Somerset, England, UK]","May 1, 2000 in London, England, UK  (natural causes)",2000-05-01,"London, England, UK  ",natural causes,"Esmond Knight  (4 October 1946 - 23 February 1987) (his death)

Schaffner, first moved to Hollywood with his family in 1927, and made the place his home for the rest of his life. Following graduation from North Hollywood High in 1936, Swink turned down a football scholarship in favor of an apprenticeship in film editing at RKO, where he remained for years, barring a World War II hitch in the US Army Special Services, editing training films. Beginning in 1944, he was promoted to cutting feature films. In 1952 Swink moved over to Paramount, where he started out with William Wyler's Gli occhi che non sorrisero (1952), and shortly thereafter received his first Academy Award nomination for Wyler's Vacanze romane (1953). In the three decades of steady work to follow, he would edit pictures as various as Il diario di Anna Frank (1959), L'amaro sapore del potere (1964), Papillon (1973) and Dinamite agguato pistola (1974), and receive two further Oscar nominations, for Funny Girl (1968) and I ragazzi venuti dal Brasile (1978). As well, he served as second unit director on a handful of films, though unlike his contemporary Robert Wise he did not make the jump to director. He might have made an excellent one, judging from the crackerjack pacing and faultless dramatic instinct evident behind all the films he touched, and the respect he garnered from the frequently demanding directors who repeatedly hired him. Meaning to retire after completing Franklin Schaffner's Sfinge (1981) in 1981, Swink was coaxed out of retirement to supervise the editing of the finally unreleased feature ""And They're Off."" He returned to work one final time: as the favorite editor of director Schaffner (they had had five prior collaborations), he was the logical choice to assemble the footage for Ritorno dalla morte (1989), as Schaffner had died before the post-production phase.","June 3, 1918 in Rocky Ford, Colorado, USA",1918-06-03,"Rocky Ford, Colorado, USA","August 15, 2000 in Santa Maria, California, USA  (heart attack)",2000-08-15,"Santa Maria, California, USA  ",heart attack,Isabelle Blodgett  (19 March 1966 - ?),1,0,0,0

nm0842770,Tilda Swinton,Katherine Matilda Swinton,179,"The iconoclastic gifts of the visually striking and fiercely talented actress Tilda Swinton have been appreciated by a more international audience of late.She was born Katherine Mathilda Swinton on November 5, 1960, in London, England. Her mother, Judith Balfour, Lady Swinton (née Killen), was Australian, and her father, Major-General Sir John Swinton, an army officer, was English-born. Her ancestry is Scottish, Northern Irish, and English, including a long tapestry of prominent Scottish ancestors. Born into a patrician military family, she was educated at an English and a Scottish boarding school. Tilda subsequently studied Social and Political Science at Cambridge University and graduated in 1983 with a degree in English Literature. During her time as a student, she performed countless stage productions and proceeded to work for a season in the Royal Shakespeare Company. A decided rebel when it came to the arts, she left the company after a year as her approach shifted dramatically: With a taste for the unique and bizarre, she found some genuinely interesting gender-bending roles come her way, such as the composer Mozart in Pushkin's ""Mozart and Salieri"", and as a working class woman impersonating her dead husband during World War II, in Karges' Screenplay: Man to Man: Another Night of Rubbish on the Telly (1992). In 1985 the pale-skinned, carrot-topped actress began a professional association with gay experimental director Derek Jarman. She continued to live and work with Jarman for the next nine years, developing seven critically acclaimed films. Their alliance would produce stark turns, such as turner-prize nominated Caravaggio (1986), The Last of England (1987), The Garden (1990), Edoardo II (1991), and Wittgenstein (1993). Jarman succumbed to complications from AIDS in 1994. His untimely demise left a devastating void in Tilda's life for quite some time. Her most notable performance of that period however comes from a non-Jarman film: For the title role in Orlando (1992), her nobleman character lives for 400 years while changing sex from man to woman. The film, which Swinton spent years helping writer/director Sally Potter develop and finance, continues to this day to have a worldwide devoted fan following. Over the years she has preferred art to celebrity, opening herself to experimental projects with new and untried directors and mediums, delving into the worlds of installation art and cutting-edge fashion. Consistently off-centered roles in Perversioni femminili (1996), Love Is the Devil (1998), Teknolust (2002), Young Adam (2003), Broken Flowers (2005) and Béla Tarr's A londoni férfi (2007) have only added to her mystique. Hollywood too has picked up on this notoriety and, since the birth of her twins in 1997, she has successfully moved between the deep-left-field art-house and quality Hollywood blockbusters. The thriller I segreti del lago (2001), earned her a number of critic's awards and her first Golden Globe nomination. Such mainstream U.S. pictures as The Beach (2000) with Leonardo DiCaprio, fantasy epic Constantine (2005) with Keanu Reeves, her Oscar-decorated performance in Michael Clayton (2007) alongside George Clooney and of course her iconic White Witch in Le cronache di Narnia - Il leone, la strega e l'armadio (2005) have cemented her place as one of cinema's most outstanding women.She then starred in the crime drama Julia (2008); in David Fincher's Il curioso caso di Benjamin Button (2008); learned Italian and Russian for Luca Guadagnino's Io sono l'amore (2009); starred in the psychological thriller ...e ora parliamo di Kevin (2011); in Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom - Una fuga d'amore (2012); in Bong Joon Ho's Snowpiercer (2013) and in Terry Gilliam's The Zero Theorem - Tutto è vanità (2013). Swinton later starred in the dark romantic fantasy drama, Solo gli amanti sopravvivono (2013) directed by Jim Jarmusch and had a small role in Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel (2014).In 2015, Swinton starred in Judd Apatow's comedy Un disastro di ragazza (2015), and played a Rock star in Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), starring opposite Matthias Schoenaerts and Ralph Fiennes.In 2016, she starred in Joel & Ethan Coen's Ave, Cesare! (2016).Swinton has been confirmed in Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria (2018), a remake of Dario Argento's 1977 film.","November 5, 1960 in London, England, UK",1960-11-05,"London, England, UK",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0842794,Loretta Swit,Loretta Swit,168,"Equally versatile at comedy and drama, Loretta Swit's parents, Polish immigrants who settled in Passaic, New Jersey, were not in favor of her making a stab at a show business career. Performing on stage from age 7, however, nothing and nobody could deter her. A natural singer who trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts before finding work in repertory companies, her features were deemed a bit too plain and hard for ingénue roles so she attempted musicals and light comedy, imbuing her characters with a snappy, comic edge. Beginning with the 1967 national touring company of ""Any Wednesday"", starring Gardner McKay, she forged ahead as a scene-stealing ""Pigeon sister"" opposite Don Rickles and Ernest Borgnine in an L.A. run of ""The Odd Couple"" and, from there, earned more laughs as the hopelessly awkward ""Agnes Gooch"" in the Las Vegas version of ""Mame"" starring Susan Hayward and (later) Celeste Holm.Arriving in Hollywood in 1970, Loretta merited some attention by lightening up a number of dramas with her humorous, off-centered performances on such TV fare as Gunsmoke (1955), Missione impossibile (1966), Hawaii Five-O (1968) and Mannix (1967). Her star-making role, however, came within two years of moving to the West Coast when she inherited Sally Kellerman's vitriolic ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan movie character for the TV series version of MASH (1972). She stayed with the show the entire eleven seasons and was Emmy-nominated every season the show was on the air (except the first).Although Loretta's post-""M*A*S*H"" career may appear less noteworthy (it would be hard to imagine anything that could top her bookend Emmy wins on the M*A*S*H series), she has nonetheless remained quite active and provided colorful support in a handful of films including S.O.B. (1981), A tutta birra (1985), Una signora chiamata presidente (1986), L'ultimo guerriero (1996) and Beach Movie (1998). She also kept up her TV visibility with episodic appearances and occasional mini-movies, including originating the role of ""Chris Cagney"" in the TV pilot of New York New York: Pilot (1981). Returning to singing on occasion, she also inherited the Linda Lavin role in the TV version of the stage musical It's a Bird... It's a Plane... It's Superman! (1975).On stage, she made her Broadway debut opposite Quella strana ragazza (1966)'s Ted Bessell in ""Same Time, Next Year"" in 1975 and later replaced Cleo Laine on Broadway in ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"". Honored with the Sarah Siddons award for her title role in ""Shirley Valentine"" (over 1,000 performances) in Chicago, she has more recently toured in productions of ""The Vagina Monologues"" and played the musical title role of ""Mame"" in 2003. Loretta also was a five-season host of the 1992 cable-TV wildlife series ""Those Incredible Animals"" (1992).Off-stage, Loretta was once married to actor Dennis Holahan, whom she met on the set of MASH (1972), in 1983. They had no children and divorced in 1995. Her natural spark and trademark blonde, curly mane are more prevalent these days at animal activist fundraisers. A strict vegetarian, she has served as a spokesperson for the Humane Society of the United States and has been multi-honored for her long-time dedication and passion to animals. She is also the author of a book on needlepoint (A Needlepoint Scrapbook), runs her own line of jewelry and exhibits watercolor paintings. As a result, little has been seen of Loretta on film and TV, into the millennium.","November 4, 1937 in Passaic, New Jersey, USA",1937-11-04,"Passaic, New Jersey, USA",,,,,Dennis Holahan  (21 December 1983 - 1995) (divorced),1,1,0,0

nm0842981,Basil Sydney,Basil Sydney Nugent,,"The son of a stage manager, Basil Sydney entered the acting profession in 1909. His burgeoning career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, during which he saw action with the Norfolk Regiment in the British Army. In the early 1920's, Basil established himself as a matinée idol on the London stage. His film debut, however, took place on the other side of the Atlantic in the silent feature Romance (1920), based on a play by Edward Sheldon. His co-star was the prominent American Broadway star Doris Keane, with whom he had appeared in the theatrical performance of the play five years prior and subsequently married. Basil was rapidly promoted through a starring role in his second screen outing, the comedy Red Hot Romance (1922), but decided to turn down the offer of a lucrative Hollywood contract. His single-minded insistence on being cast exclusively in roles based on works by Shakespeare or Shaw led him to New York and back to the theatre. He spent the remainder of the decade as a leading player on Broadway, playing the parts he craved and duly receiving critical plaudits for his Mercutio of ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1922-23) and for his leads as Hamlet (1925-26) and Petruchio in ""The Taming of the Shrew"" (1927-28).Basil did not return to films until 1932, back in Britain and henceforth as a burly character actor, albeit of never less than commanding presence. His stock-in-trade were shifty opportunists, public servants, domineering fathers or military types. He alternated smoothly between charming or dependable and menacing or sinister. Generally typed as a quintessential Englishman, his casting as a German infiltrator in the wartime drama È andata bene la giornata? (1942), lent additional gravitas to the warning against complacency. Otherwise, he stood out as Caesar's military aide-de-camp Rufio in the decidedly stodgy screen adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's Cesare e Cleopatra (1945); as the brutish squire Nick Helmar in the period Gainsborough melodrama Jassy la zingara (1947); as the indefatigable Captain Smollett battling the pirates of L'isola del tesoro (1950) and as Waldemar Fitzurse, advisor to the devious Prince John (played by Guy Rolfe) in MGM's excellent Technicolor swashbuckler Ivanhoe (1952).","April 23, 1894 in St. Osyth, Essex, England, UK",1894-04-23,"St. Osyth, Essex, England, UK","January 10, 1968 in London, England, UK  (pleurisy)",1968-01-10,"London, England, UK  ",pleurisy,"Joyce Howard  (1946 - ?) (divorced) (3 children)

Around the time she met Reeves, Jennifer worked as an assistant to director David Lynch, and was even featured briefly in his film Strade perdute (1997).

He was a member of The Rhymers Club, a collection of poets that included William Butler Yeats, and was a contributor to ""The Yellow Book"". He was made the editor of a new magazine, ""The Savoy"", in 1896.Symons was acquainted with many of the top French writers and poets of the era, including Paul Verlaine, Stéphane Mallarmé and Joris-Karl Huysmans. He was a champion of the so-called ""Symbolist Movement"", and in 1899 published a book, ""The Symbolist Movement in Literature"", which was a major influence on such writers as Yeats and T.S. Eliot. His own poetry, in such works as ""Days and Nights"" (1889) and ""London NIghts"" (1895), was geared more toward the urban life he gravitated towards rather than the pastoral romantic settings of many of his contemporaries.Symons suffered a nervous breakdown in 1908, and it took him almost two years to recover from it. From 1910-30 he produced mostly books and writings on travel, literary criticism and translations of other authors' works.

Born on January 6, 1934, she was educated at convent schools before receiving dramatic training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. A repertory player by the time she was discovered for films by the British star Anna Neagle and her director/husband Herbert Wilcox, the lovely demure blonde started out auspiciously enough in the delinquent film My Teenage Daughter (1956) in which she played Neagle's troubled daughter. This was followed by a second Neagle/Wilcox collaboration with No Time for Tears (1957). Excelling whether cast in stark melodrama, spirited adventure or harmless comedy fluff, Syms' film list grew impressive in the late 1950s and early 1960s working alongside the likes of John Mills and Anthony Quayle in Birra ghiacciata ad Alessandria (Pattuglia disperata) (1958), Curd Jürgens and Orson Welles in Passaggio a Hong Kong (1959), Lilli Palmer and Yvonne Mitchell in La guerra segreta di suor Katryn (1960), Laurence Harvey in Espresso bongo (1959), William Holden in Il mondo di Suzie Wong (1960), and Dirk Bogarde in the landmark gay-themed Victim (1961), playing the unsuspecting wife of Bogarde's closeted male. Ably portraying innocent love interests throughout the years, she graced a number of pictures without ever nabbing that one role that would truly put her over the top. She was nominated, however, three times for British Film Academy Awards--twice for best actress in L'adultero (1957) and No Trees in the Street (1959) and once for supporting actress in Il seme del tamarindo (1974) that starred Julie Andrews and Omar Sharif. The 1970s saw quite a bit of TV series work and she played British prime minister Margaret Thatcher at one point on both stage and TV. She grew plumper with middle age and found herself immersed in character roles, offering support in such films as Absolute Beginners (1986), Shirley Valentine - La mia seconda vita (1989) and Vite sospese (1992). American audiences have recently seen her as the dog-doting ""Princess Charlotte"" in the light teen comedy Una ragazza e il suo sogno (2003) with Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth, and treading water as the Shelley Winters character in the TV-remake of Poseidon - Il pericolo è già a bordo (2005).

In 1958 he joined IDHEC. During an internship, he landed in Rome on the set of La Giornata Balorda by Mauro Bolognini, screenplay by Moravia and Pasolini.

nm0845867,Oleg Tabakov,Oleg Pavlovich Tabakov,176,"Oleg Tabakov was a renown Russian actor, director, and public figure, who played over 100 roles in film and on TV. He is best known for his roles as Count Nikita Rostov in Voyna i mir (1966) by Sergey Bondarchuk, and as Oblomov in the eponymous film by Nikita Mikhalkov.He was born Oleg Pavlovich Tabakov on August 17, 1935, in Saratov, Russia, USSR. His father, Pavel Kondratevich Tabakov, and his mother, Maria Andreevna Berezovskaya, were medical doctors in Saratov. His parents separated during the Second World War, and young Tabakov was brought up by his single mother and grandmother. He attended the all-boys school in Saratov, and was active in the drama class. From 1950-1953 he studied acting at the Saratov House of Pioneers under the legendary acting coach Natalia Iosifivna Sukhostav.In 1953, Tabakov moved to Moscow and entered the Moscow Art Theatre (MKhAT) School of Acting. He attended the class of Vasili Toporkov, graduating in 1957 as an actor. He made his film debut as Sasha in Sasha vstupayet v zhizn (1957) by director Mikhail Shvejtser, in 1956. That same year he became the youngest of the six founding members of Sovremennik Theatre under the directorship of Oleg Efremov. From 1957 - 1983, he was member of Sovremennik. There he played leading roles in such productions as 'Goly Korol' (aka.. Naked King), 'Tri Zhelaniya' (aka.. Three Wishes), 'Obyknovennaya istoriya' (aka.. Ordinary story) and other contemporary Russian plays. From 1970 - 1976 Tabakov was General Manager of Sovremennik, he promoted Galina Volchek to Principal Director of the company.Since 1970s Tabakov had been teaching young actors at his master-class. Many of his students became successful professionals on stage as well as in film industry. His teaching credentials included workshops and productions at the Paris Conservatoire, the British American Drama Academy, Akademie Der Künst in Hamburg, the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna, Carnegie Mellon, The Juilliard School, New York University, Florida State University, The University of Delaware, and Harvard University.In 1978 Tabakov and his students opened the ""Tabakerka"" Theatre in downtown Moscow. There Tabakov produced and directed several successful plays, such as 'Vesnoi ya vernus k tebe' (aka.. I'll be back in Spring), 'Proschay Maugli' (aka.. farewell to Maugli), and 'Belosnezhka i sem gnomov' (aka.. Snowhite and seven dwarfs). However, regardless of success with public and steady critical acclaim, the Soviet officials did not authorize Tabakov's new theatre, and his company dissolved by 1982. At that time Tabakov was depressed and transferred to MKhAT. There he played one of his best stage roles, Salieri, in the popular play 'Amadeus' under directorship of Oleg Efremov. Over the course of his acting career Tabakov appeared in about 150 roles, he also directed over 30 international stage productions.During the 1990s, Oleg Tabakov was a strong supporter of democratic reforms and freedom in the new Russia. He made public speeches and was involved in many public events facilitating the cultural transformation of arts and theatres in Russia. Having himself experienced the Soviet control and suppression during his creative career, Tabakov became one of the leading proponents of cultural reforms in Russia. His efforts came to fruition in the revival of the Moscow Art Theatre under his leadership, as well as his participation in numerous cultural and political events in Russia. Over the course of his life and career, Oleg Tabakov rose to become one of the living symbols of artistic freedom in Russia. However, during the last years of life, Tabakov had shown public support of the ruling regime of Russia, supposedly out of the desire to help his students and the actors of his theatre.Since 2000, after the death of his friend Oleg Efremov, Tabakov had been Artistic Director of Moscow Art Theatre named after A. Chekhov. He was also the Artistic Director of ""Tabakerka"" Theatre, and the leading actor in both companies. He was awarded the USSR State Prize for the Arts, the Russian State Prize for the Arts, and other national and international awards and decorations from Hungary, France, Poland, and the USSR. Oleg Tabakov was designated People's Actor of the USSR and Russia (1980s), and was decorated with the Order of Merit of Fatherland II degree, by the Russian president Vladimir Putin (2005).Oleg Tabakov has been married twice. His first son, Anton Tabakov, is an actor and also a successful night-club owner in Moscow. Since 1996, Oleg Tabakov had been married to actress Marina Zudina and the couple had two children, son, Pavel (b. 1996), and daughter, Maria (b. 2006).

Actor Kristoffer Tabori was born in Malibu in 1952 and appeared in one of his mother's films Weddings and Babies (1958) as a youngster. His parents divorced when he was barely a year old and his mother subsequently married Hungarian writer/director George Tabori. Kristoffer would use the name ""Tabori"" for his own. He started making the theater rounds in the late 60s, and took his first official stage bow with ""The Merchant of Venice"" at the Berkshire Theatre Festival in 1966. He debuted on Broadway with ""The Guns of Carrar"" two years later. Other plays followed (""Habeas Corpus,"" ""Hamlet,"" ""Dreams of a Blacklisted Actor"") and in 1970 he won the Theatre World Award for ""How Much How Much."" Kristoffer became a product of his generation playing lean hippie and liberal thinker types. In movie bits as a late teen, one of those was an unbilled appearance in his father's cop action drama L'uomo dalla cravatta di cuoio (1968), one of several that had Siegel directing Clint Eastwood. Tabori's stage success led to progressive strides in 70s film. He earned strong reviews for his first lead in _Makin' It (1971)_ as a sex-obsessed 17-year-old who suffers a heavy, traumatic experience with his mother, played by Joyce Van Patten. Such films as _Pigeons (1971)_ and Journey Through Rosebud (1972) did not pave the way to stardom, however, and he started impressing on TV instead with quality mini-movies including ""The Glass House (1972), ""QBVII"" (1974), ""The Lady's Not for Burning"" (1974) and ""A Memory of Two Mondays (1974). He turned more and more to the stage in the mid-70s and joined the Arena Stage theater company in Washington, D.C. from 1976-1978, and California's South Coast Repertory and National Shakespeare Festival the following decade. He married British actress Judy Geeson in 1984 and they appeared notably on stage together in ""The Common Pursuit"" before divorcing a few years later. Tabori focused on directing in the 90s, predominantly on TV, helming episodes for such series as ""Picket Fences,"" ""Chicago Hope,"" ""Providence"" and ""Judging Amy."" Shortly before his mother's death in 1995, he appeared as her son in the film Last Summer in the Hamptons (1995).

Ralph Taeger was born of German-speaking parents on July 30, 1936 in Richmond Hill, New York. Very shy as a youngster, he took public speaking to try and overcome his social handicap. He went so far as to pursue acting roles in college plays and in summer stock. An aspiring pro baseball player, he stayed for a time on a Dodger farm team but knee injuries forced him to rethink his future plans. He enrolled instead at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, attending classes and finding work as a male model on the sly. He migrated to the West Coast where a stage performance at the Beverly Hills Playhouse caught the eye of an MGM talent scout. Signed briefly, he made a couple of bit appearances in films before he was let go. He then freelanced on TV and found it a more accepting medium. Seeing his potential as a strong but silent, clean-cut, adventurous type, he gravitated toward crime and western series including ""Highway Patrol,"" ""Manhunt"", ""Tombstone Territory"" and ""Sea Hunt."" His first series lead was as rugged Mike Halliday in La valle dell'oro (1960), an action show that took place during the Alaskan gold rush of 1897. It co-starred James Coburn and barely lasted half the season. He and Coburn seemed to have some chemistry, however, so they simply changed the locale, updated the time to present-day Mexico and called their new adventure series Acapulco (1961). This time he played studly Patrick Malone, a former Korean War vet-turned-beachcomber assigned to protect a criminal lawyer from rampant gangsters. This show did even worse and died after only two months on the air. Taeger earned a last chance at TV stardom with the title role in Hondo (1967), which was based on the 1953 John Wayne western. As cavalry scout Hondo Lane, Taeger experienced a more interesting character, a lonely, embittered man whose Indian bride was slain during an army massacre. Though he and it showed definite potential, it didn't arouse enough of an audience and dissolved after only three months. Despite a lead role in the feature film Il leggendario X 15 (1961) co-starring Mary Tyler Moore and support parts in Duello a Thunder Rock (1964), Madame P... e le sue ragazze (1964) and the glossy George Peppard/Carroll Baker starrer L'uomo che non sapeva amare (1964), he was pretty much finished in Hollywood. It didn't help that he had also gained a reputation for being difficult on the set. Married and with one son, Taeger went on to sell cars and work for a time as a tennis pro. In later years he earned a living as a wholesaler of firewood in Northern California, appearing in local theater productions every now and then.","July 30, 1936 in Queens, New York City, New York, USA",1936-07-30,"Queens, New York City, New York, USA","March 11, 2015 in Placerville, California, USA  (after a long illness)",2015-03-11,"Placerville, California, USA  ",after a long illness,Linda Jarret  (9 July 1967 - 11 March 2015) (his death) (1 child),1,0,1,1

nm0847186,Rumiko Takahashi,Rumiko Takahashi,,"Takahashi was born on October 10, 1957 in Niigata, Japan. She displayed no special talent or interest for manga (Japanese comics) while attending Niigata Chuo High School, but while attending Japan Women's University, she enrolled in Gekiga Sonjuku, a manga school founded by Kazuo Koike (artist and writer of the mangas Lone Wolf and Cub, Crying Freeman and Lady Snowblood). His influence in her work is considerable. He stressed the importance of interesting characters in one's manga series. Takahashi took his lessons to heart: her characters often break the stereotypes inhabiting manga at the time. Takahashi takes care to portray her women to be as tough and as intelligent as her men. Almost none of them can be called an out-and-out villain. They often have different motivations and goals which puts them at odds with each other, and from this arises the dramatic tension of her stories, and quite often, the comedy as well.In 1976 she started publishing short manga. At this point, she needed to make an important decision, continue as a manga artist or make rounds interviewing for a regular job as a Japanese salary person. If she failed in manga, she would have difficulty getting work because companies would often prefer young, fresh graduates. Despite her parents' advice to take the more cautious path, she decided to press on.Her first manga series was Urusei Yatsura in 1978, published in Weekly Shonen Sunday. It concerns an alien invasion of earth that can only be stopped if the horniest boy in the world manages to catch an alien girl. It eventually became a cultural phenomenon, lasting nine years and spawning a long-running television series, Lamù la ragazza dello spazio (1981). Lamù la ragazza dello spazio (1981)was partly directed by Mamoru Oshii (_""Kôkaku kidôtai"" (1995)_, aka Ghost in the Shell). Oshii first rose in prominence thanks to his work in Urusei Yatsura.Her second manga hit was Maison Ikkoku (1980 to 1987 in Big Comic Spirits). Here, her experiences as a young adult making the rounds of job interviews, plus living in a small apartment while working for a living, became inspiration for her manga. Maison Ikkoku doesn't have any aliens, demons or martial-arts experts, instead it is a simple love triangle between a college student, Godai, his beautiful apartment manager, the young and recently widowed Mrs. Kyoko Otanashi and the rich, handsome tennis coach Shun Mitaka.Mitaka could have been a typical love rival, rich, handsome but self-centered. Instead, Takahashi actually makes him sympathetic; his love for Kyoko is as sincere as Godai, and he is also a nice guy. In fact it becomes one of the themes of Maison Ikkoku: if all things are equal, if both suitors have good characters and both sincerely loves the woman, then should Kyoko pick the richer suitor? The manga series charts Godai's maturation from callow youth ruled by hormones to a successful, responsible adult.The complex webs of relationships in Urusei and Maison are her secret recipe for generating endless configurations of conflict and humor. They keep readers waiting eagerly for the next installment at the same time gently remind them that that's how life is like with regards to romance, a tangled free-for-all that, despite its seemingly frightful messiness, Takahashi magically keeps clear and coherent for her readers.Maison Ikkoku also became the successful anime, Cara dolce Kyoko (1986). In 1987, Not only did she end her two successful manga, Urusei and Maison, she also did short manga (Mermaid Saga and One-Pound Gospel), and started her third long-run manga series, Ranma 1/2.In 1987, the manga field was full of martial arts stories, so Takahashi was interested in trying her version of a martial arts manga, however, with a few innovations of her own. Ranma is a martial artist betrothed to a tomboy martial artist, Miss Akane Tendo, and when they marry they will inherit the dojo and the tradition of ""Anything Goes"" Martial Arts. The big twist is, when Ranma gets wet, he turns into a busty, red-headed girl. Takahashi pokes fun at (and gives homage to) martial arts, boy-girl relationships and other bizarre permutations that can arise from a web formed by a boy/girl, a tomboy girl as well as a menagerie of quirky supporting characters.Like Urusei and Maison, Ranma became an anime series,Ranma ½ (1989), which lasted from 1989 to 1992. She ended the manga in 1996, and then started her fourth major manga series, Inuyasha.Inuyasha is set in medieval Japan. A modern schoolgirl, Kagome, is magically transported to the past, and she must help the half-demon Inuyasha collect shards of the powerful Shikon jewel. In this series, the tone is darker and less comedic than her other works. Characters and bystanders often die here and the major characters themselves are frequently in danger. Takahashi also introduces her first purely evil villain, the demon Naraku. Naraku is a kind of Iago to Inuyasha's Othello, letting others do the dirty work for him. Inuyasha became an anime in 2000 (Inuyasha (2000)), lasting until 2004. It has already spawned several films, with the last one released in December, 2004.In terms of material rewards, Takahashi consistently makes the list of top ten Japanese tax payers from the manga community, an indication of the royalties she receives for her work, both old and new. Her fan base has spilled out of Japan, where she is virtually ubiquitous. She now has devoted followers from Europe, the United States and many fellow Asian nations. Her old work, from Urusei Yatsura up to her short manga up to the anime versions, have been reprinted and translated, finding their way to newer generations of readers and viewers.However, Takahashi continually keeps busy, meeting her deadlines, creating new manga. She admits she has little time to spend her money, devoting most of her time in her studio drawing and plotting the next installments of her manga, for the sake of her legions of fans worldwide.","October 10, 1957 in Niigata, Japan",1957-10-10,"Niigata, Japan",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0847264,Ken Takakura,Goichi Oda,180,"Ken Takakura was a Japanese actor best known for his brooding style and the stoic, honorable presence he brought to his roles.Known as the ""Clint Eastwood"" of Japan, Takakura gained his streetwise swagger and tough guy persona watching yakuza turf battles over the lucrative black market and racketeering in postwar Fukuoka. This subject was covered in one of his most famous movies, Shôwa zankyô-den (1965) in which he played an honorable old-school yakuza among the violent post-war gurentai.A graduate of the prestigious Meiji University in Tokyo, Takakura happened by an audition in 1955 at the Toei Film Company, and decided to look in. Toei found a natural in Takakura as he debuted with Denkô karate uchi (1956) (Lightning Karate Blow) in 1956. As luck would have it, Japan experienced a boom in gangster films in the 1960s as the Japanese people struggled with the generational differences between those raised in pre-war and post-war Japan and these were Takakura's stock in trade. His breakout role came in 1965 playing a ex-con antihero in Abashiri Bangaichi (1965). By the time he left Toei in 1976, he had appeared in over 180 films.Takakura gained international recognition after starring in the 1975 Sydney Pollack sleeper hit Yakuza (1974) with Robert Mitchum and is probably best known in the West for his role in Ridley Scott's Black Rain - Pioggia sporca (1989) in which he surprises American cops played by Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia by showing he can speak English. He again proved himself bankable to Western audiences in the 1992 Fred Schepisi comedy Campione... per forza! (1992) starring Tom Selleck.While he slowed down a bit in his older years, he remained active.

nm0847727,Oleg Taktarov,Oleg Nikolaevich Taktarov,183,"""Oleg makes an impression."" On his DVD commentary for ""Righteous Kill"" (2008), director Jon Avnet remarks that he needed a powerful actor to play Russian mob enforcer Yevgeny Mugalat, a character who survives six gunshots at close range. International star Oleg Taktarov, born in Sarov, Russia, proved uniquely capable of fulfilling Avnet's demanding expectations. When Oleg first appears on camera as Mugalat, the director states emphatically in the audio commentary that the actor ""makes an impression."" Long before ""Righteous Kill,"" Oleg already left global audiences with memorable impressions as ""The Russian Bear,"" a UFC champion who took unconventional paths up to the top of the world's most difficult professions: acting and fighting.Today, Oleg ranks among Russia's three most popular movie stars and its highest paid actors. His frank autobiography, ""Up To The Top,"" is a best seller in Russia where Oleg's series ""The Guardian"" was also a number one television show. In America, Oleg works with the A List of actors and directors in hit blockbusters. He will play one of the leads with Adrien Brody and Topher Grace in ""Predators"" (2010), produced and written by action film innovator Robert Rodriguez. Oleg's distinguished list of achievements began while he was only a child in Sarov, a home to some of Russia's most eminent scholars and scientists. By age twelve, he was a recognized martial arts expert throughout the country.Before he came to America in 1994 to pursue his dream of acting in the movies, Oleg Taktarov was an established global hero with records as the World Sambo Champion, the Russian National Judo Champion, and a four-time European and Asian Jujitsu Champion. Just six months after his arrival in the United States, Oleg defeated David ""Tank"" Abbott in July 1995 and became the reigning UFC Champion. At his classic 1996 ""Superbrawl"" with Ken Shamrock in Buffalo, New York, Oleg's fans in the U.S. audience waved signs that declared, ""Russian Bear becomes American Hero!""With the momentum of his UFC success and an enthusiastic American fan base to support him, Oleg learned English and studied acting at the prestigious L.A. Playhouse. After minor roles in a handful of Hollywood movies including ""Air Force One"" (1997), Oleg beat a thousand actors competing in auditions for his first significant film part as one of the antagonists in John Herzfeld's ""15 Minutes"" (2001) starring Robert DeNiro.Again, Oleg made an unforgettable impression in ""15 Minutes"" as an unrelenting baddie, who aspires to be a movie director and steals a camcorder to photograph the criminal mayhem he inflicts upon Manhattan. During the shoot, Robert DeNiro shared acting advice with Oleg who returned the favor with pointers for more realistic fight scenes. The two were reunited for Avnet's ""Righteous Kill"" (2008), also starring Al Pacino.After ""15 Minutes,"" Oleg played charismatic heroes in ""Red Serpent"" (2002) and in the remake of ""Rollerball"" (2002). Reflecting events in his own life as a fighter, Oleg's character in ""Rollerball"" incites wild cheering by the fans in a Kazakhstan arena when he resists the dictates of a greedy sports league owner played by Jean Reno. Oleg continued to build his impressive resume' in American movies and television series with performances in ""Bad Boys II"" (2003), ""National Treasure"" (2004), ""Alias"" (""The Two,"" 2003), and ""Navy NCIS"" (""Judgment Day,"" 2008). He returned to movies depicting the brutal street culture of New York City with his riveting performances in ""Rockaway"" (2007) and ""We Own the Night"" (2007) with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix. James Gray, the director of ""Night,"" compared Oleg to a ""young Charles Bronson,"" another dynamic Hollywood actor of Russian heritage.Oleg's dramatic leading work in American films has proven that he can deliver both big moments and subtle ones. In ""Rockaway"" (2007), he quietly recounts a brutal memory of his character's service in Afghanistan with harrowing pain. In ""Montana"" (2008), Oleg's sympathetic hero Nikolai escapes from his adversaries into the streets of Los Angeles where he is befriended and hidden by a single mother and her son. Before the final showdown, Nikolai symbolically mends the fences between the everyday people of the U.S. and Russia. Oleg's empathetic performance of a Russian seeking a new life in America enables the film to succeed on many levels as a personal drama, crime adventure and a plea for understanding. At the premiere of ""Montana,"" Oleg said, ""I already knew all about this hero.""During one of his triumphant nights as UFC Champion, Oleg exited the ring after a victory and stated to a reporter, ""I can do anything."" It was not an idle boast. The fans of Oleg Taktarov know that ""Up To The Top"" is only the first chapter in volumes of future achievements by the native son of Sarov. When ""Rolling Stone"" celebrated its fourth year of publication in Russia, the magazine sponsored an exhibit of its celebrity photographs in Moscow. Oleg's dramatic photograph was a highlight of the exhibit, proving that the ""Russian Bear"" has fought his way to the top and achieved rock star status.","August 26, 1967 in Arzamas-16, Gorkovskaya oblast, RSFSR, USSR [now Sarov, Nizhegorodskaya oblast, Russia]",1967-08-26,"Arzamas-16, Gorkovskaya oblast, RSFSR, USSR [now Sarov, Nizhegorodskaya oblast, Russia]",,,,,Masha  (? - present),1,0,0,0

nm0847939,Lyle Talbot,Lysle Francis Henderson,182,"Lyle Talbot, who appeared in over 150 movies from leads in Warner Bros.' ""pre-Code"" pictures to countless supporting roles, and later enjoyed a steady TV career as a character actor, was born Lysle Henderson on February 8, 1902, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He grew up in a small town in Nebraska, where after the early death of his mother, he was raised by her mother, Mary Hollywood Talbot, whose name he later bore professionally.Talbot's incredibly long and varied show-business career began right after high school, when he joined a traveling tent show. Starting out as a magician-hypnotist's assistant, he worked his way up to magician before quitting the carny's life for that of the stock theater. He learned to act with stock companies throughout the Midwest, where he became a leading man, and even formed his own short-lived company in Memphis, Tennessee, ""The Talbot Players,"" which included his actor father and stepmother, Ed and Anna Henderson.By 1931 he was in Hollywood as the talkies were maturing. He had the good looks of a star but, more importantly, he had a rich baritone voice that the talkies needed. After a screen test in which he inadvertently mocked Warner Bros. production head Darryl Zanuck but impressed director William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman, Talbot was signed by Warner Bros.-First National. The studio gave him a plum part in William A. Wellman's Love Is a Racket (1932) co-staring with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Ann Dvorak and the fast-talking Lee Tracy. He appeared in ""A"" pictures in the 1930s in supporting roles, including Three on a Match (1932), 20.000 anni a Sing Sing (1932), and Una notte d'amore (1934) (with opera star Grace Moore), but his work was mostly in ""B"" pictures, in which he frequently played leads. Although he thoroughly enjoyed the work, acting was practiced as an assembly line operation at the time. Actors would be assigned work usually based on 12-hour days and six-day weeks, and commit themselves to the infamous seven-year exclusive contract that included draconian suspension penalties in the fine print. Talbot, along with James Cagney, Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis (ironically all WB contract players), were outspoken in their commitment to change working conditions for actors. Talbot was one of the founders of the Screen Actors Guild and the first employee of the Brothers Warners to join the union, much to their ire.As a matinee idol during the Depression, frequently playing a gangster or tuxedo-clad man about town, Talbot co-starred with the leading actresses of the day, including Ginger Rogers, Mary Astor, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Glenda Farrell, Kay Francis, Mae West, Ann Dvorak, Loretta Young, Carole Lombard and Shirley Temple.Later, as a character actor, Talbot appeared as Commissioner Gordon in the 1949 serial Batman and Robin (1949) and was Lex Luthor in Atom Man vs. Superman (1950) the next year. Talbot took on a tremendous number of roles, either because he was not discriminating enough, always wanted to keep working, or simply appreciated the money. In the early 1950s he appeared in several of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s most notorious films, including the infamous transvestite tear-jerker Glen or Glenda (1953) and the famously inept Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957). Aside from Bela Lugosi, Talbot was Wood's most famous star.Talbot's acting career thrived on television, in which he appeared from the beginning of the medium until the 1980s. He co-starred as Ozzie Nelson's friend Joe Randolph on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952) and as Robert Cummings' Air Force buddy in The Bob Cummings Show (1955) (also known as ""Love that Bob"") and made guest appearances on a plethora of TV series, including Il carissimo Billy (1957), Il cavaliere solitario (1949), Topper (1953), The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show (1950), Perry Mason (1957), Gli uomini della prateria (1959), Carovane verso il west (1957), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962), La fattoria dei giorni felici (1965), Charlie's Angels (1976), Bravo Dick (1982), Hazzard (1979) and Casalingo Superpiù (1984).Throughout his film and TV career, Talbot continued to perform on stage, co-starring in ""Separate Rooms"" on Broadway in the early 1940s and starring in national touring companies of Neil Simon's ""The Odd Couple"" and summer stock tours of Gore Vidal's ""The Best Man"" and Thornton Wilder's ""The Matchmaker."" In 1967 he co-starred in a revival of ""South Pacific"" at New York's Lincoln Center with Florence Henderson.Lyle Talbot died of natural causes on March 3, 1996, in his home in San Francisco, California, at the age of 94, the last of the SAG founders to shuffle off this mortal coil.","February 8, 1902 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA",1902-02-08,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","March 2, 1996 in San Francisco, California, USA  (congestive heart failure)",1996-03-02,"San Francisco, California, USA  ",congestive heart failure,"Margaret Carol Epple  (18 June 1948 - 18 March 1989) (her death) (4 children)

nm0848191,Patricia Tallman,Patricia Tallman,173,"When she portrayed ""Lyta Alexander"" in the Hugo Award-winning sci-fi series Babylon 5 (1993), Patricia Tallman was the most powerful telepath in the universe. Seems fitting, considering that the actress knew she was going to be in show business at the early age of two. It was then that she first appeared with her father, Jerry, on his Midwest radio show, soloing on ""Bicycle Built for Two"".By age 15, Pat was performing in summer stock at the Red Barn Theatre in Saugatuck, Michigan, doing ten shows in 11 weeks. She soon spent all of her high school vacations in professional summer stock, and eventually chose Carnegie Mellon University to earn a BFA in its prestigious theater arts program. While other theater majors waited tables, Pat worked her way through college, performing in eighteen musicals at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera. Recognizing Pat's formidable talents, CMU presented her with an award for Outstanding Achievement in Acting.Immediately after college, Pat moved to New York City, where she landed a role in the long-running off-Broadway hit ""Big, Bad Burlesque"". She went on to score other parts on the New York stage, including her favorite, ""Rosalind"" in the Riverside Shakespeare Company's production of ""As You Like It"". Television roles began shortly thereafter, when Pat was cast in a recurring role on the CBS soap opera, Sentieri (1952). This led to roles on virtually every New York-based daytime serial. Film roles were not far behind. George A. Romero contacted her to play a role in his feature Knightriders (1981), starring Ed Harris. This led to a long working relationship with him.Pat relocated to Los Angeles , where she again worked with Romero on Creepshow 2 (1987). The film she is perhaps best known for followed: George Romero and Tom Savini's remake of the 1968 cult classic, La notte dei morti viventi (1990). The move to L.A. was a smart one, Pat discovered, as she was soon cast as undercover cop ""Christy Russell"" on NBC's Generations (1993), and as an evil, sexy swashbuckler in the I moschettieri del 2000 (1992). Other films include Sweet Justice - 5 donne per una vendetta (1992), Beneficio del dubbio (1993), Austin Powers - Il controspione (1997) and Austin Powers - La spia che ci provava (1999). Television shows include Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), Star Runner (1990) (A USA Network pilot), Dark Skies - Oscure presenze (1996), Babylon 5 (1993) and ""The Universe and Harry Morgann"" (an independent pilot).Pat's other projects include starring in the science-fiction thriller Never Die Twice (2001) and playing one of the leads, Lt. Richmond, in two audio plays, ""Lives of the Cat"" and ""Anne Manx"". In addition, her voice can be heard in the cartoon ""Babylon 5"" parodies Babylon Park: Frightspace (1999) and Grudge Match (2000). Equally important to Patricia are her roles of mother to son her Julian, as well as her fund-raising activities for the children of Penny Lane.Through her tireless efforts within the science fiction community, Pat and her fans have contributed more than $250,000 to Penny Lane over the past several years, the bulk of which transformed the CARE Computer Lab dream into reality. Since 1996, Pat, her friends, family and fans have made a holiday happen for the Penny Lane kids, through the Be A Santa program.Dedicated Patricia Tallman fans make a hobby of trying to spot her in her many stunt performances. An extremely athletic and former fearless member of the Stunt Woman's Association of Motion Pictures, Pat has tumbled, slid and taken punches for the likes of Laura Dern (in Jurassic Park (1993)), Gates McFadden (in ""Star Trek: Generations""), Geena Davis (in Spy (1996)) and Laura Prepon (in Karla (2006)).Pat's roots as a stage actress have never left her, and she continues to tread the footlights in Los Angeles whenever film and TV work allow her the time. Her latest projects include Dead Air (2009), a psychological horror film directed by Corbin Bernsen, for which her performance is getting great reviews.

nm0848226,Constance Talmadge,Constance Alice Talmadge,168,"Constance was blonde; star sister Norma Talmadge was brunette. She was buoyant and a comedienne; Norma was introspective and a tragedienne. Nicknamed ""Dutch"" by her stage mother Peg as she looked like a cherubic Little Dutch Boy, silver screen star Constance Talmadge was one of silent pictures' most popular and enduring stars of romantic comedy.Born in Brooklyn in April 19, 1898 (various sources give different years ranging from 1897 to 1903), her New York City childhood was humbling and tragic. Their father Fred Talmadge was a chronic alcoholic who ultimately deserted his family, which included sister Natalie Talmadge, while all three girls were quite young. By the time Norma had become a commodity for Vitagraph Studios, Constance, in her early teens, begged to follow.Constance's first comedy short for Vitagraph was In Bridal Attire (1914). As the two sisters were as different as night and day, professional jealousy never entered into the picture. In fact, all three sisters remained consistently loyal throughout their lives. Appearing in a number of two-reel comedies predominantly with comedian Billy Quirk, Constance drew major acclaim in the role of The Mountain Girl in D.W. Griffith's epic masterpiece Intolerance (1916). Her role was so inspiring that when Griffith re-issued her segment as a solo feature entitled The Fall of Babylon (1919), he re-shot her death scene ending so that her character would wind up living happily ever after.Throughout the late '10s and early '20s the elegant Constance charmed audiences with a number of flapper-era comedy vehicles, many of them co-starring silent film great Harrison Ford (not related to the present-day star). These include A Pair of Silk Stockings (1918), Happiness a la Mode (1919), Romance and Arabella (1919), Wedding Bells (1921) and The Primitive Lover (1922). She grew so much in stature that she eventually formed her own production company. Constance, as did sister Norma, abruptly left films with the advent of sound. The notion that they willingly abandoned their careers while very much on top does not quite ring true. Both she and Norma's pronounced and rather squeaky Brooklyn accent did not prove all that suitable for talkies (particularly for the dramatic Norma) and it's more likely that they left Hollywood on their own terms before they were shunned.Both sisters invested wisely in business ventures in later life. Married four times, Constance became reclusive and fell victim (as did sisters Norma and Natalie) to alcohol abuse in later years.

Schenck. Natalie married Buster Keaton in 1921. She only played one further role, ""Virginia Canfield"" in Keaton's Accidenti che ospitalità! (1923). She had worked for Comique as a script girl/secretary for Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle in 1917, and traveled west with the troupe when Schenck found new premises for ""Roscoe"" in California. She spent a lot of time signing autographs on behalf of her popular sister, Contance. Anita Loos, author of ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"", wrote a book called ""The Talmadge Girls"", which is mainly about Constance and Norma; Loos based the philosophy of ""Lorelei Lee"" on the philosophy of Peg Talmadge (""Get the money, and then get comfortable""). Natalie ended her days after her divorce from Keaton in a house in Santa Monica, a confirmed alcoholic.

nm0848232,Norma Talmadge,Norma Marie Talmadge,163,"Norma Talmadge was born on May 26, 1895, in Jersey City, New Jersey. The daughter of an unemployed alcoholic and his wife, Norma did not have the idyllic childhood that most of us yearn for. Her father left the family on Christmas Day and his wife and three daughters had to fend for themselves. Her mother, Peggy, took in laundry to help make ends meet. By the time Norma was 14 she took up modeling. She was successful enough that she attracted the attention of studio chiefs in New York City (where the Vitagraph studio was located at the time). Norma landed a small role in The Household Pest (1910). With her mother's prodding, she landed other small roles with the studio in 1910, such as Uncle Tom's Cabin (1910), Love of Chrysanthemum (1910), A Dixie Mother (1910) and A Broken Spell (1910). By 1911 she was improving as an actress, so much so that she landed a good part in A Tale of Two Cities (1911). By 1913 she was Vitagraph's most promising young actress. In August of 1915 Norma and her mother left for California and the promise of success in the fledgling film industry there. Her first film in Hollywood was Captivating Mary Carstairs (1915). The film was not only a flop but the studio that made it, National Pictures, went out of business.During this time her sister, Constance Talmadge, was working for legendary director D.W. Griffith. Constance managed to get Norma a contract with Griffith's company. Over the following eight months Norma made seven feature films and a few shorts. After the contract ran out, the family returned to the East Coast. In 1916 she met and married producer and businessman Joseph M. Schenck. With his backing they formed their own production company and turned out a number of films, the first of which was Panthea (1917). It was a tremendous hit, as was Norma. In 1920 the production company moved to Hollywood, where the big hits of the day were being produced. Her company produced hits such as The Wonderful Thing (1921), The Eternal Flame (1922) and The Song of Love (1923).By 1928 Norma's popularity had begun to fade. Her film The Woman Disputed (1928) was a flop at the box-office. Her final film was Madame Du Barry (1930). By that time ""talkies"" were all the rage, but Norma's voice did not lend itself to sound and she was out of work. She divorced Schenck and married George Jessel. Jessel had his own radio show and Norma was added to the cast to help its sagging ratings. She thought this might be the vehicle by which she would revive her stalled film career, but the show continued its decline and was ultimately canceled, and with it the hopes of rebuilding her shattered career. She was finished for good.She divorced Jessel in 1939 and married Dr. Carvel James in 1946. She remained with him until she died of a stroke on Christmas Eve of 1957 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

nm0848251,William Talman,William Whitney Talman Jr.,178,"William Talman is best known for his role as Hamilton Burger, the district attorney who perpetually lost to Perry Mason in the long-running series Perry Mason (1957). Talman was an accomplished screenwriter and stage and screen actor, and appeared in numerous roles on television as a character actor from the mid-'50s until his death from lung cancer in August of 1968.He was born William Whitney Talman Jr. on February 4, 1915, in Detroit, Michigan, the first son of William Talman Sr. and Ada B. Talman. His father was vice-president of an electrical company that manufactured industrial heat-measuring recording devices and yachts. During an interview with ""TV Guide"" in April of 1963, Talman told writer Richard Gehman that his father made a good deal of money, ""enough to send me to school in a limousine each day. Public school. That meant I had to fight my way in and out."" In school Talman developed an avid interest in athletics, especially boxing and baseball. He furthered his interest in boxing early in life by fighting on the local parish boxing team of the Episcopal Church. At one point in his life he played semi-professional baseball. He was educated at Cranbrook School and later attended Dartmouth College, where his interest in acting first took hold. He left Dartmouth in his sophomore year after an incident in which a freshman he knew ""loaned"" him a car so that he could go visit a girlfriend at Smith College. A bus forced the car off of the road and it hit a tree. A boy who was with them was killed and it later turned out that the car was stolen. Talman was asked to resign from Dartmouth, which he did. Although invited back the next year, he never returned.Talman began his acting career on Broadway in the early 1940s. His first roles were in ""Beverly Hills"", ""Yokel Boy"" and ""Of Mice and Men."" He was appearing in ""Spring Again"" at Henry Miller's Theatre in January of 1942 when he received his draft notice for induction into the US army. Prior to leaving for active duty he married actress Lynne Carter. He entered the army as a private and saw 30 months of service in the Pacific, where he won a commission and eventually was promoted to the rank of major. During the war his assignments included the managing of a school that trained soldiers to put on shows. At one point he was in charge of training boxing and baseball teams. He was proud of the fact that his teams won both the boxing and baseball championships of the Western Pacific. Talman returned to Broadway after the war. Two of his more notable postwar roles were in Joseph M. Hyman's and Bernard Hart's production of ""Dear Ruth"" in 1946 and Henry Adrian's production of ""A Young Man's Fancy"" in 1947. In 1949 the actor moved to Hollywood and began making films. His first picture was Ho sposato un demonio (1949), in which he played gangster Bunny Harris. Other movie and television roles soon followed. In 1951 his wife sued him for divorce, citing extreme cruelty. She claimed that Talman had criticized her publicly in front of their friends. The divorce was granted in September of 1952 with custody of the couple's three-year-old daughter, Lynda, and 24% of Talman's income awarded to his former spouse. He went on to perform in over 17 films, several of which he starred in. Some of his more notable films include La gang (1951), Sterminate la gang! (1950), Segnale di fumo (1955), Un pugno di criminali (1955), Operazione 'z' (1952) and La signora dalle due pistole (1955). His best known role was as escaped killer and kidnapper Emmett Myers in the classic film noir La belva dell'autostrada (1953), directed by Ida Lupino. He also co-wrote two feature films, L'uomo che visse due volte (1956) and Il ritorno di Joe Dakota (1957).Talman married actress Barbara Read in 1952. The couple had two children, Barbie and Billy, but they separated in September of 1959. In a tragic turn of events, his former wife took her own life in December of 1963 by closing up her house and turning on the gas jets. Notes she left behind blamed ill health for her action. In March of 1960 Talman made headlines when he was arrested during a police raid of an alleged ""wild nude party"" being held at the home of an acquaintance, Richard Reibold. The incident caused CBS to invoke a morals clause in his contract that cost him his job on ""Perry Mason."" The charges were eventually dropped after a trial that was closely followed by the newspapers and sensationalized by the tabloids. Talman always maintained his innocence, and following the trial the judge in the case criticized the police for arresting him. He remained off the show until December of 1960, when CBS reinstated him after a flood of fan mail from supporters. He married Margaret (Peggy) Flanigan and adopted her two children from a previous marriage, Steve and Debbie. After the ""Perry Mason"" show ended in 1966, Talman went on a six-week tour of Vietnam to entertain the troops. Upon his return home, it was discovered that he had lung cancer. His last film was La donna del West (1967), with Doris Day.Near the end of his life, Talman did something that, while common nowadays, was an extraordinarily courageous thing for an actor to do at that time. A heavy smoker for most of his life, he was angered by a newspaper article he read about actors being afraid to make anti-smoking messages for fear of losing opportunities to make lucrative cigarette commercials. He decided to do something about it. Talman volunteered to make a short film for the American Cancer Society, part of which was shown in late 1968 and 1969 as a television anti-smoking commercial. He was the first actor to ever make such a commercial. When the message was being filmed, Talman knew he was dying, was in a great deal of pain and was in fact under heavy sedation for it. The short film begins, ""Before I die I want to do what I can to leave a world free of cancer for my six children . . . "",William Talman died of cardiac arrest due to complications from lung cancer at West Valley Community Hospital in Encino, California, on August 30, 1968, at the age of 53. Although his life was short, he left an enduring legacy through his writing, his acting, his heroism and his never-ending championing of the underdog.","February 4, 1915 in Detroit, Michigan, USA",1915-02-04,"Detroit, Michigan, USA","August 30, 1968 in Encino, Los Angeles, California, USA  (lung cancer)",1968-08-30,"Encino, Los Angeles, California, USA  ",lung cancer,"Margaret Larkin Flanigan  (5 November 1961 - 30 August 1968) (his death) (2 children)

His first steps were taken within a Romanticism that was beginning to be old fashioned, but gradually progressed toward Realism and high comedy, joining the neoclassical comedy. He started by making adaptations, like the one titled 'Joan of Arc' (1847), on Schiller's 'The Maid of Orleans', one of his reference authors, or more or less clear imitations, as 'An adventure of Richelieu', inspired by Alexandre Dumas. It is provided with his tragedy 'Virginia' (1853). He triumphed with 'Rich female' (1854), and 'Madness of Love' (released on January 12, 1855), a historical drama about the jealous Queen Juana the insane and her husband Philip the Handsome, showing the influence of the German playwright Friedrich Schiller. An adaptation for the screen was filmed by Juan de Orduña and interpreted by Aurora Bautista. When her love collides with the interests of the State, the nobles ask her to defend Castile against her husband. When he died, she cries and shows a true love for him, oblivious to the reason of state. Later works, such as 'The Snowball' (1856) place Tamayo in the high comedy of Realism. His most famous work was 'A New Drama' (1867), inspired by Shakespeare's theatre, where he mixed the theme of the play within a play with adultery. In 1870, following the failure of his drama 'Good men', he decided to give up writing and focus his life in other activities, since he was appointed Permanent Secretary of the Royal Spanish Academy (1874) and director of the National Library (1884) and the squad of archivists.

nm0848667,Akim Tamiroff,Akim Mikhailovich Tamiroff,170,"Though born in Russia and having a Russian-sounding name, Akim Tamiroff is actually of Armenian descent. At 19 he decided to pursue acting as a career and was chosen from among 500 applicants to the Moscow Art Theater School. There he studied under the great Konstantin Stanislavski, and launched a stage career. This included road company productions, in one such tour in 1920 Tamiroff came to New York City, which he liked so much he decided to stay there. Broadway suited him, and he worked steadily with the Theatre Guild from the mid-1920s to the early 1930s. He was a short, stout man with a guttural baritone voice and a thick but rather generic Russian accent that, with his skill in characterizations, seemed to mesh with any role calling for a foreign type--whether European, Middle Eastern or Asian. His voice became his principal asset. He came west to Hollywood in 1932 to break into the movie business, and first appeared on screen in a bit part in La scomparsa di miss Drake (1932). Until 1934 his appearances were usually uncredited, but he managed to stand out in several films, one of his best roles of the time being the servant Pedro of John Gilbert La regina Cristina (1933). By early 1934 he was much in demand, appearing in 12 films during that year. The next year was even busier for him, with roles in 15 films altogether, and not just bit parts--he was getting more feature supporting roles, such as Gopal the emir in I lancieri del Bengala (1935) and the comic puppet master Rudolpho in the adapted operetta Terra senza donne (1935). He signed with Paramount in 1936 but was often loaned out to other studios. He went to Warner Bros. for one of his earliest big supporting characters: the sly Cuban mercantile agent Carlo Cibo in Avorio nero (1936). For Paramount, his General Yang in Il generale morì all'alba (1936) brought him his first of two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Along with substantial supporting roles in top movies, Tamiroff was getting starring roles in ""B"" pictures, allowing him to show his range by playing everything from amiable rogues to thoroughly evil villains. Two of his roles from that time exemplify what a versatile actor he was. As French trapper and scout Dan Duroc of Giubbe rosse (1940), he was something of a rascal but with a sense of humor and dignity. However, as the vile Colonna in I vendicatori (1941), he is irredeemably wicked, and deservedly dies in the longest sword duel on film. For his role as the self-serving guerrilla Pablo in Per chi suona la campana (1943), Tamiroff received his second Oscar nomination. He continued through the decade with more fine work, and in 1949 he joined the cast of Cagliostro (1949) and met Orson Welles, who played late 18th-century charlatan Cagliostro. The two became friends and associates in Welles' later film projects. Through the 1950s Tamiroff's time was fairly divided between TV productions and films earlier in the decade and a surprising number of episodic TV and more films later. His three films with Welles, as director and sometime actor, were: Rapporto confidenziale (1955) with its Wellesian maze of flashbacks; the over-the-top L'infernale Quinlan (1958) with its gritty surrealism and incredible cast; and Il processo (1962) (The Trial), Welles' stylistic spin on the Franz Kafka story. Certainly it was in ""Touch of Evil"" (the best of the lot) that Tamiroff's Tijuana boss Uncle Joe Grandi--outlandishly bug-eyed alternately with fear or mercurial anger intensified by Welles' wild camera angles--stood out as a most intriguing character. He took a last fling at Broadway in 1959. For the 1960s Tamiroff continued to sample American TV but was still very active in American, French and Italian movies. His voice and talent were still a draw in films like Topkapi (1964) and Agente Lemmy Caution: Missione Alphaville (1965). In addition, he remained on call for Welles' meandering/unfinished Don Quijote de Orson Welles (1992) as Sancho Panza for nearly twenty years. One of the great character actors of film history, Akim Tamiroff appeared in over 150 screen projects.","October 29, 1899 in Tiflis, Russian Empire [now Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia]",1899-10-29,"Tiflis, Russian Empire [now Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia]","September 17, 1972 in Palm Springs, California, USA  (cancer)",1972-09-17,"Palm Springs, California, USA  ",cancer,Tamara Shayne  (10 February 1933 - 17 September 1972) (his death),1,0,0,0

nm0849011,Kinuyo Tanaka,Kinuyo Tanaka,,"Tanaka Kinuyo was a highly regarded and prolific actress best known for her films with director Mizoguchi Kenji. She was immersed in the world of film having received her start in the world of entertainment at age fourteen, being a filmmaker herself, being the cousin of director Kobayashi Masaki and, very much like Hara Setsuko and Ozu Yasujiro, being anecdotally romantically linked with the aforementioned Mizoguchi. The director would later recommend against her being hired as a director, which caused a rift between the two. She received her first known credit in Shochiku's Genroku Onna in 1924. She stayed to become the studio's biggest actress, and a paradigm of beauty, until approximately 1949 when she travelled to the United States Of America as an ambassador of Japanese culture. Upon her return from the US the Japanese detected a change of attitude in her, as well as noting a new short hairdo, which momentarily lead to some criticism. She had married director Shimizu Hiroshi, with whom she had worked, in 1929. Sources claim this was a mere cohabitation however. The marriage lasted a matter of months, but the two worked together beyond their romantic union. She married another one of her directors Gosho Heinosuke, but not before also starring in several Ozu films. It looked like films like Aizen Katsu and Naniwa Onna would be the height of her fame with all their popularity, but post-war films like Life Of Oharu, Sansho The Bailiff and Ugetsu were even bigger classics and immortalized the actress. Another of her many other noteworthy performances was in The Ballad Of Narayama based on a tradition and folklore of Japan. As if to complete her tour de force of Japanese cinema she directed several films and even worked with Kurosawa Akira in Red Beard. She died of a brain tumor in 1977.","November 28, 1910 in Yamaguchi, Japan",1910-11-28,"Yamaguchi, Japan","March 21, 1977 in Japan  (brain tumor)",1977-03-21,Japan  ,brain tumor,Hiroshi Shimizu  (? - ?) (divorced),1,1,0,0

Instead, Luise Rainer, an Austrian actress, got the role and won the Oscar for Best Actress. After that, still in Paris, Michiko made Yoshiwara (1937) and Il tiranno del Tibet (1938) (""Storm Over Asia"").There, she met German superstar 'Victor de Kowa', they fell in love and got married in 1941, with the permission of Mr. Julius Meinl, who was the best man for the wedding.

After four years with the company, he became a producer, with his first film production being Kita no san-nin (1945). He was set to begin work on a Japanese-Indonesian film called ""Eiko no Kanatani"" (Behind the Glory); however, the Indonesian government did not grant work visas to the Japanese cast and crew. As a result, he had to think of something big enough to replace the scrapped movie. During a trip home to Japan, Tanaka peered out the airplane window and gazed towards the dark ocean below, wondering what lay beneath those waves. Then, he got the brilliant idea: make a film about a gigantic monster. Thus, Godzilla was born!With a respected team of crew members including Director Ishirô Honda, Special Effects Man Eiji Tsuburaya and Composer Akira Ifukube, these ""Four Fathers"" created the first ever Godzilla (1954) movie, which would go on to become one of the highest-grossing films in Japan of all time and would feature a monster that would be a most recognizable and lasting icon of pop-culture not only in Japan, but in countries around the world. Tanaka would go on to produce 21 of the many sequels to Godzilla (1954), and other Toho sci-fi films such as Rodan il mostro alato (1956), I misteriani (1957), Daikaijû Baran (1958), Mosura (1961) and Atragon (1963).

He was the youngest of four children having two older brothers and one older sister.His early education was at the New Method College or the Sun Fat College. After graduation and having armed himself with a degree in Chinese History, Alan entered the teaching profession of Chinese History.His first starring role was actually at age 16 in a 1964 movie called The Student Prince. He got this role after some school friends showed his picture to the people making a movie at their secondary school. His role in this early movie earned the nickname of ""The Prince.""In the 1970s it was reported that Tang made a salary of HK$150,000 per picture because he was so popular. In one 1974 article Alan Tang said that he was working on six movies at same time. Tang said, however, that he only worked on one film a day and that made it difficult for producers. In 1974, Tang not only starred in the Splendid Love in Winter with Chen Chen but also produced it. He talks about being so tired from working on his businesses that he could barely talk to Janet when he returned home at night. In another case, Tang describes having insomnia when he was separated from Janet. He was filming in Taiwan and Janet was in Hong Kong. It is no wonder then that the pair had occasional difficulties especially since the press reported their every move. It is a tribute to their love that Alan and Janet have remained together all these years in spite of living under constant scrutiny.He found his main fame though when he moved to Taiwan and made many dramas and romances - often pairing off with Brigitte Lin during the 70s, in such films as Run Lover Run. Tang made over 60 films in Taiwan.Later after his star faded a bit, he began producing films - two of them the Wong Kar-wai films As Tears Go By and Days of Being Wild. He still appeared in a number of films - generally of the triad genre - such as Flaming Brothers, Gangland Odyssey, Return Engagement, Gun N' Rose and The Black Panther Warriors.","September 20, 1946 in Shunde County, Guangdong Province, China",1946-09-20,"Shunde County, Guangdong Province, China","March 29, 2011 in Mong Kok, Hong Kong  (heart attack)",2011-03-29,"Mong Kok, Hong Kong  ",heart attack,Janet Yim  (? - ?) (his death) (2 children),1,0,1,2

Appearing in a number of minor Eurasian parts in such French films as Marchandes d'illusions (1954) [Nights of Shame], Alì Babà (1954) [Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves], and Mannequins de Paris (1956) [Mannequins of Paris], she was also featured in a couple of Japanese productions before branching out internationally.The cameras displayed a lovely, quiet beauty in the 1950s and she was absolutely beguiling opposite Dirk Bogarde in the ""Sayonara""-like WW2 film Il vento non sa leggere (1958) with Bogarde portraying a British POW in a Japanese camp who flees in order to locate his ill wife [Ms. Tani] who initially was his language teacher. She also was quite appealing in another film that dealt with turbulent ethnic themes. The Italian/French/British co-production of Ombre bianche (1960) co-starred Tani as the wife of Eskimo Anthony Quinn in a culture clash between Eskimos and Canadians that leads to murder. While fetching to the eye, the actress was rather modest in talent and was soon relegated to ""B"" and ""C"" level movies. In the 1960s she became a customary player of meek princess-in-distress types in such costumed adventures as L'avventura di un italiano in Cina (1962), Maciste alla corte del Gran Khan (1961) [Maciste at the Court of the Great Khan] and Ursus e la ragazza tartara (1961) [The Tartar Invasion], which co-starred her one-time husband, French actor Roland Lesaffre.She was under-utilized in Hollywood as well in her few attempts. Minor supporting roles in La mia geisha (1962) and Le 5 mogli dello scapolo (1963) left her deep in the shadows of leading ladies Shirley MacLaine and Elizabeth Montgomery, respectively. Left to playing a dribbling of femme leads in such lowgrade spy intrigue and sci-fi, she was little seen after the late 1960s. In later years she enjoyed painting and was devoted to her religion and her dog that she named ""Toto"".

nm0850290,Alla Tarasova,Alla Konstantinovna Tarasova,,"Alla Konstantinovna Tarasova was born on February 6, 1898, in Kiev, Russian Empire, into an aristocratic family. Her father, named Konstantin Tarasov, was a military doctor in Kiev. Tarasova's sister was married to Russian Prince Svyatopolk-Mirsky. From 1910-1914 Young Tarasova studied at the Private Gymnasium of Titarenko on Fundukleevskaya street in Kiev. She was fond of theatre and attended the performances of Moscow Art Theatre on tour in Kiev. In 1914 she moved to Moscow and took acting class with Nikolai Massalitinov at the Acting School of Moscow Art Theatre.In 1916 Tarasova became a permanent member of the 2nd company of the Moscow Art Theatre. At the age of 18, she shot to fame with a leading role of Finochka in ""Zelenoe Koltso"", a play by Zinaida Gippius. She married Alexei Kuzmin, who fought in the Russian Civil War in the White Army and then emigrated from Russia. During the 1922 tour with Moscow Art Theatre in New York, Tarasova defected and joined her husband. She tried an acting career on Broadway, but failed because of her poor English. She worked as a waitress at her husband's café and was not planning to go back to Russia. At the end of 1924 Tarasova was convinced to go back by the letter from Stanislavsky, who insisted on her return to Moscow Art Theatre. She returned to Moscow, but had no serious roles for a few years. In 1931 she married the leading actor Ivan Moskvin and her career took off again. Tarasova became the undisputed leading actress of the Moscow Art Theatre under directors Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. She made her best stage works in classical plays of Maxim Gorky and Anton Chekhov that were staged by director Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko during the 1930's. Her most resounding success was a title role in staging of ""Anna Karenina"" in 1937. The same theatrical production was recorded on film in 1953, when Tarasova and her partners were much older than at the time of their legendary premiere.Tarasova was received with mixed reviews by the Russian intellectuals émigrés during her international tours. At the same time she was the favorite actress of Joseph Stalin, who frequently attended her performances at the Moscow Art Theatre. Tarasova was made the ""first official actress"" of the Soviet Union. In 1937 she became the first actress to be designated the People's Artist of the Soviet Union. She was five times awarded the State Stalin's Prize, in 1941, 1946, 1947, 1948, and 1949. She received numerous awards and decorations and was also twice awarded the Order of Lenin and was made the Hero of Socialist Labor. However, her film career was limited to only a few roles, mainly in the films of director 'Vladimir Petrov' (I). She died on April 5, 1973, in Moscow. Tarasova left a peculiar will about her burial arrangements: instead of being buried at the prestigious Novodevichy Cemetery, she was laid to rest next to her mother at the Vvedenskoe Cemetery in Moscow, Russia.","February 6, 1898 in Kiev, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire [now Kyiv, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine]",1898-02-06,"Kiev, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire [now Kyiv, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine]","April 5, 1973 in Moscow, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]",1973-04-05,"Moscow, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]",,,0,0,0,0

He and his family moved to Chicago, IL when he was 7 years old, after his father defected to the US. His interest in comic books and animation led him to study animation at CalArts in Los Angeles. While he was there he produced two student films, one of which was the basis of his series Il laboratorio di Dexter (1996). The character of Dee-Dee was inspired by his older brother Alex, who would often spoil younger brother Genndy's plans (as Dee-Dee does to Dexter). His first long form directing work was for the TV movie of the series, Dexter's Laboratory: Ego Trip (1999). He also directed animation for his collaborator Craig McCracken on Le superchicche (1998) and Le superchicche - Il film (2002).His most celebrated work was the epic animated series Samurai Jack (2001), featuring a time-traveling samurai in a battle of good vs. evil. He stopped work on the series to produce Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003) as a direct story tie-in to the beginning of Star Wars: Episodio III - La vendetta dei Sith (2005). He then directed animation for the Adult Swim pilot Korgoth of Barbaria (2006). Plans were up in the air for over a decade for a possible movie conclusion to Samurai Jack, as well as directing a sequel to Dark Crystal (1982). He created storyboards for the action-packed opening of Iron Man 2 (2010) during this time period.Genndy produced another dynamic TV series Sym-Bionic Titan (2010), before finally landing his first feature on Hotel Transylvania (2012), which would involve taking over a tumultuous production and incorporating 2D techniques to 3D animation. Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015) was the first film for which he had creative control over the entire production, although it was still in the style developed during the first film. In 2017, he finally returned to direct a darker season of Samurai Jack to conclude the story on Adult Swim. He is currently directing Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation (2018).","January 17, 1970 in Moscow, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]",1970-01-17,"Moscow, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]",,,,,Dawn David  (21 October 2000 - present) (2 children),1,0,1,2

Her parents were Jewish immigrants, her father from Bialystok, Poland, and her mother from Germany. After toying with some stage work, she made her film debut with Experience (1921). That was her only film of that year, and the next year she also made only one film, Head Over Heels (1922) (this was at a time when some studios and their performers were turning out a film per week). She had no other offers for 1923, but her constant rounds of the casting offices finally did some good. In 1924 she appeared in no less than six films.

She was one of the College's rare female students, because she was interested in the drama lessons it offered and its theatrical facilities. Afterwards, she applied four times to become a student of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, whose alumni included famed actors such Laurence Olivier and Peggy Ashcroft. Tate's application became accepted at her fourth attempt.In the 1990s, Tate started her television career with small roles in the police procedural ""The Bill"" (1984-2010) and the fire-brigade themed drama ""London's Burning"" (1988-2002).

Tate has occasionally revived the characters in the number of television specials, broadcast from 2009 to 2015. The show allowed Tate to win 2 British Comedy Award, a Royal Television Society Award, and a National Television Award.Tate's newfound popularity in the United Kingdom helped her receive more theatrical roles, and to make frequent guest appearances in other television shows. In 2006, Tate played the character Donna Noble in the ""Doctor Who"" Christmas special ""The Runaway Bride"". In the special, Donna is a secretary for a Torchwood Institute subsidiary company, who is about to get married to fiance.

Tate was praised for performing well in both the comedic and tragic scenes involving the character.

nm0851466,Arthur Tauchert,Arthur Tauchert,,"One of Australia's most popular early actors, Arthur William Tauchert was of German-Irish extraction. He initially gained recognition on the vaudeville circuits of Sydney and Melbourne, first as a 'parody' singer, later as a member of various different vaudeville troupes. By 1913 he had gained a high profile from touring around the country. He was engaged by producer Raymond Longford to play 'The Bloke' in an adaptation of C.J. Dennis' humorous poem 'The Sentimental Bloke'. This film, now regarded an Australian classic, was an enormous critical and popular success, and established Tauchert's widespread fame. He often made personal appearances before screenings, reciting passages from the original poem. Although he made a triumphant move into the talking era with movies such as 'Showgirl's Luck' (1931), the Australian industry itself was in a slump. He focused his energies on radio, until failing health led him to be hospitalised. He died in 1933. He was, both in real life and onstage, an accessible 'everyman' hero, with a rough exterior but a heart of gold - an image enhanced by the charitable work he participated in for many worthy causes.","August 21, 1877 in Waterloo, Sydney, Australia",1877-08-21,"Waterloo, Sydney, Australia","November 27, 1933 in Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia  (cancer)",1933-11-27,"Darlinghurst, Sydney, Australia  ",cancer,Elizabeth LeBean  (14 September 1909 - 27 November 1933) (his death),1,0,0,0

nm0851537,Norman Taurog,Norman Rae Taurog,173,"A successful child actor (on stage from 1907) and rather less successful romantic lead, baby-faced Norman Taurog found being behind the camera a more rewarding experience. Before becoming a director, he paid his dues as a prop man and editor. By 1919, he was put in charge of two-reel comedies, starring the comic Larry Semon. These films were made on the East Coast and it was not until 1926, that Taurog moved to Hollywood. His directing career really took off with the coming of sound, and he soon acquired a reputation as a specialist in light comedy. He also developed a singular penchant for working with children, often giving them chocolate rewards for good acting. They, in turn, called him 'Uncle Norman'. Taurog became the youngest-ever director to win an Oscar. This was for the film Skippy (1931), which featured child actor Jackie Cooper, his real-life nephew.Taurog was under contract at Paramount from 1930 to 1936. The pick-of-the-bunch among his films - and a solid box office hit - was Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch (1934), starring the noted stage actress Pauline Lord, comedienne Zasu Pitts and the irrepressible, idiosyncratic W.C. Fields. On loan to David O. Selznick, he also did justice to Mark Twain by creating just the right atmosphere for Le avventure di Tom Sawyer (1938), eliciting a strong performance from Jackie Moran in the role of Huck Finn. Initial footage had been in black & white, but Taurog discarded this and re-shot the film in Technicolor, which worked particularly well with art director Lyle R. Wheeler.After a stint with Fox (1936-37), Taurog then had his best (and longest) spell with MGM (1938-51). His A-grade assignments for the studio included the iconic La città dei ragazzi (1938), the exuberant Balla con me (1940) and the thoroughly entertaining Judy Garland musical Presenting Lily Mars (1943), based on a best-selling novel by Booth Tarkington. In 1952, he returned to Paramount, where he was utilised on the strength of his proven ability to make films economically and on time. Taurog made the most out of the feather-light scripts he was handed for a string of comedies with Dean Martin and/or Jerry Lewis. He was also a favorite of Elvis Presley, directing in total nine of his films.As the law of diminishing returns applied, Taurog retired in 1968. He later taught at the University of California School of Cinema and remained a board member of the Director's Guild. He became blind towards the end of his life, but for his last years served as director of the Braille Institute in Los Angeles.","February 23, 1899 in Chicago, Illinois, USA",1899-02-23,"Chicago, Illinois, USA","April 7, 1981 in Rancho Mirage, California, USA  (undisclosed)",1981-04-07,"Rancho Mirage, California, USA  ",undisclosed,"Susan Ream Broderick  (16 September 1944 - 7 April 1981) (his death)

This sort of feat has given Jay an onset reputation as a bit of a daredevil. But it is more accurate to say he is master of an impressive repertoire of physical skills.

Hitchhiking to Hollywood in 1942, the youthful Taylor screen-tested at Warner Brothers but was rejected because of his draft status. MGM, not as fussy, signed him to a contract and immediately put him to work, assigning him the minuscule role of a soldier in director Clarence Brown's sentimental slice of Americana, La commedia umana (1943). More minor roles followed before Taylor enlisted in the Army; but even there he continued to act: Playwright/screenwriter Moss Hart chose him to play one of the leads in the United States Army Air Forces' production of Hart's play, ""Winged Victory."" Taylor met his first wife, actress Phyllis Avery, when she was also in Winged Victory. Returning to civilian life, Taylor resumed his work in pictures with a top role in the trend-setting crime drama La città nuda (1948). In later years Taylor became a film and TV director, being nominated for an Emmy for his direction of an episode of The Farmer's Daughter. Taylor met his second wife Hazel Court when he directed her in a 1958 episode of Alfred Hitchcock presenta (1955).","December 13, 1920 in Freeport, Pennsylvania, USA",1920-12-13,"Freeport, Pennsylvania, USA","December 29, 1998 in Los Angeles, California, USA  (heart failure)",1998-12-29,"Los Angeles, California, USA  ",heart failure,"Hazel Court  (25 March 1963 - 29 December 1998) (his death) (2 children)

nm0852365,Forrest Taylor,Edwin Forrest Taylor,,"Minor American character actor Forrest Taylor was a veteran of the stage by the time he started appearing as a silent lead in both short and feature-length films. He went on to appear in hundreds of secondary ""B"" movies, although his name does not appear in a large percentage of them. Taylor was born Edwin Forrest Taylor in Bloomington, Illinois, in 1883. Little is known about his early days on stage but he assayed prime roles in such films as In the Sunset Country (1915), April (1916), True Nobility (1916) and The Abandonment (1916) before World War I service intervened. With his leading-man career fatally interrupted, he would not return to films until a decade later in 1926. Playing a few strong supports, he regressed quickly to atmospheric bits primarily in westerns and cliffhangers. With a no-nonsense attitude and imposingly thick mustache, his attorneys, judges, scientists, executives and professors were for the most part scarcely acknowledged, so when he did receive a bit more screen time than usual he pounced on the opportunity, such as he got in John Wayne's programmer Il cavaliere del destino (1933) where he played a sagebrush villain; the serial Shadow of Chinatown (1936) as a Chief of Police; and The Oregon Trail (1939) as a nemesis to hero Johnny Mack Brown. Taylor also managed some deliciously hammy roles in a few popular serials including The Green Archer (1940), The Spider Returns (1941) and The Iron Claw (1941). On-camera for nearly five decades, he extended himself into TV programming in the 1950s, taking part in various TV westerns including episodes of Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (1951), Annie Oakley (1954), Le leggendarie imprese di Wyatt Earp (1955), Maverick (1957) and Frida (1955), not to mention both Gene Autry's and Roy Rogers' weekly shows. He was an occasional player on the series The Cisco Kid (1950) from 1950 on, and from 1952-1954 had one of his more visible roles as Grandpa Fisher on the religious TV series The Fisher Family (1952). Broaching the age of 80, Taylor finally retired in 1962 after filming an episode of Bonanza (1959) and died three years later of natural causes in Garden Grove, California.","December 29, 1883 in Ellsworth, Illinois, USA",1883-12-29,"Ellsworth, Illinois, USA","February 19, 1965 in Garden Grove, California, USA  (pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure)",1965-02-19,"Garden Grove, California, USA  ","pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure","Anne Hutchinson Berryman  (1925 - 19 February 1965) (his death) (1 child)

For the next ten years, and over four hundred touring performances, he was part of a three actor ensemble in an original production based on Appalachian storytelling. Venues ranged from tents, prisons, and colleges to a run at the Manhattan Theatre Club. His film career began with two notable movies, John Sayle's, Matewan, and Mark Rydell's, The River. Soon, he was enlisted to play the character of Uncle Bogg in the television series Christy. His many film credits over the years include the role of Sheriff Guidry in Joseph Sargent's, A Lesson Before Dying, which gathered an Emmy for best picture and In 2005 director Phil Morrison brought Frank in to play the folk artist David Wark in the independent Junebug. It was a Sundance favorite and was on many of the year's ten best films lists. Diane Bell met Frank when she and Chris Byrne were visiting friends at his home at the River Farm in Virginia. They saw the bee hives, ate from the garden, and heard some great live music. Later, in conversation, she briefly mentioned a script called Obselidia she was completing. Several months later she contacted Frank to see if he had any more honey, he did, and to ask if he and bees would be in her movie. And they were. Though the bees that worked on location in the desert near Death Valley turned out not to be from the from the River Farm, but were their California cousins. Unfortunately, they could not accompany Frank to the premiere in the knee-deep snow at Sundance. They were returned to their home in the locust groves near the foot of Mount Whitney.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Additionally he performed similar employment at Ciba Giegy Pharmaceuticals and at Bristol Meyers Squibb where he received several sales awards. In 1991 he moved to Paul Sundries where he quickly advanced from Sales Manager to VP of Sales & Marketing. He achieved this by acquiring such accounts as Ralph's, Vons, Wal-Mart, Kmart, Thrifty, Payless Drugs and Sally's Beauty Supply. Overall He increased revenues at Paul Sundries from $4 million dollars to $11 million dollars and when he left the organization he was Vice President of the company. In 1994 Carson Products hired him as the West Coast Regional Manager and in 1994 he also started his own business, ETMA Sales. ETMA Sales represented several of the industries leading African American hair care products. In 1998 he purchased two retail beauty supply stores, which he was able to sell for a profit in 2002.His entrepreneurial and desire for the entertainment industry lead him to producing and acting in films. In 1996 his film ""The Spartan"" was accepted in the Sundance Film Festival and received praises. After this he spent three years trying to finance a cross-audience dark comedy produced and directed by African American filmmakers. Hollywood did not believe in this type of film project, yet his sales skills prevailed and the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) stepped up to give him the opportunity to complete the film. The financing for the film, `The Gristle"", prove to be a ground breaking event both for the film industry and the SBA. He was the first producer to ever receive the support of the SBA in financing a feature length film. During 2000 the publicity generated by ""The Gristle"" and the ""runaway production"" phenomena led the SBA, with his assistance and expertise, to develop a pilot financing program for Domestic Filmmakers. Geno spear headed this pilot program for the SBA and created Public Eye Entertainment to funnel film projects of other producers as well as his own film projects through the programs process. Public Eye Entertainment assisted filmmakers in obtaining funds from the SBA to complete their films. Geno worked for the company as CEO/President for 18 months. From day one the Bush administration put the program on turn around, initially making it almost impossible to process a loan, to eventually terminating the program. Good-bye Public Eye Entertainment!!!

Holland attended Quaker schools, then majored in drama at Bennington College. At the age of 22 Holland moved to New York with the desire to become a ""great big Broadway star."" After fifteen years of ""disappointments and near misses"" in New York and California, Holland was cast as Ruth Dunbar in the sitcom Henry e Kip (1980) with Tom Hanks. It was Holland's ""breakout"" role and it led to many other TV and film offers including the movie All'inseguimento della pietra verde (1984) as Kathleen Turner's book publisher and friend.

In 1992 Holland was still living in Greenwich Village, New York and traveling back and forth between a rented apartment in Hollywood and New York in order to work on both coasts. Holland has said her first love was the theater but the work for her in TV and films was better. However, by 1992, Holland said she was dealing with traveling back and forth ""less and less well"".

nm0852616,John Taylor,Nigel John Taylor,188,"Nigel John Taylor is most well-known for his bass work in the popular band, Duran Duran, which he also co-founded. As schoolboys, he and Nick would sit around and daydream about the band they would one day front. It was then that they finalized a timeline for the band: they were to play Hammersmith Odeon by 1982, Wembley Arena by 1983, and Madison Square Garden by 1984. They managed to accomplish their goal, and also became one of England's biggest acts worldwide. However, their success was short-lived as internal tensions drove the band to split in two. John, with guitarist Andy Taylor, formed the splinter group Power Station, with singer Robert Palmer and drummer Tony Thompson, most well-known for his drumming with Diana Ross, Chic and David Bowie. Power Station's music was more rock-oriented than what Duran Duran had been doing. Remaining members Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, and Roger Taylor (no relation to the drummer of Queen, or either Taylor in the band) formed the avant garde band, Arcadia. These two bands, in turn, splintered Durannies (the fanatical, at times obsessive Duran Duran fans) into two groups as well, not knowing whose side to be on. This was a short-term problem, however, as Andy and Roger Taylor separately left the group in the 1985-1986 period. The recording of their fourth studio album, ""Notorious"", became a nightmare with remaining members arguing, John threatening to leave the group too, and them having to resort to suing Andy to get him to come record. No one is now sure which guitarist appears on what song (aside from Andy, they also used Nile Rodgers on some songs, who also produced the album, and Warren Cuccurullo, formerly of Missing Persons and later to become a member of Duran Duran). By the release of their album, their popularity had waned, especially when fans heard a different, more mature sound. They were no longer just pop, and had ventured into a more funky territory. As their popularity waned and all but dried up into the rest of the 80s and early 90s, John met and eventually married hopeful actress Amanda De Cadenet. The two also had a daughter a couple months later, Atlanta Noo Taylor (Noo is short for Noodlehead, not Knew as the press reported). The marriage was short-lived, as arguments and rumours of infidelity caused the couple to file for separation in 1995. Their divorce was finalized in 1997.Around this time, John's tensions with the band reached a head. With each album, John threatened more and more to leave the band and, in early 1997 at the DuranCon, he finally announced to everyone, including the band, that he was leaving. He'd already recorded and released some solo material, so he wasn't really leaving to go solo, at least not in terms of music. With his divorce and drug problems (since the early 90s, he'd tried to kick his coke habit), he felt he needed to be free of everything for once. In 1999, he finally regained some stability in his life and married Gela Nash, co-founder of the hugely successful ""Juice Couture"". Also, in 2001, things came full circle as he and the rest of the Taylors announced they would be rejoining Duran Duran.","June 20, 1960 in Hollywood, Birmingham, England, UK",1960-06-20,"Hollywood, Birmingham, England, UK",,,,,"Gela Nash  (16 March 1999 - present)

nm0852710,Kent Taylor,Louis William Weiss,183,"Born Louis William Weiss on May 11, 1907, Kent Taylor was a modestly popular ""B"" actor of the 1930's and 1940's. The tall, dark and handsome leading man who sported rugged looks, a slick, pencil-thin mustache and solid physique, was star material with the potential and durability of Clark Gable and Errol Flynn, but lacked their consistent leading man quality and charisma. An avid outdoorsman, Taylor churned out over 110 films during his lengthy career, appearing in a number of quality ""A"" pictures as a second lead.Born just southeast of Nashua, Iowa, he was a son of farmers. As a teenager, he performed in several high school plays. The family then moved to Waterloo, Iowa, where he worked as a window trimmer in a ladies' clothing shop. After a brief move to Chicago, the family relocated to Los Angeles, where he and his father started an awning company. Taylor pursued acting as a profession after being introduced to director Henry King. After an unbilled debut in The Magnificent Lie (1931), he apprenticed for a couple of years in bit parts. He peaked in the 1930's with prominent support roles in Merrily We Go to Hell (1932) with Fredric March and Sylvia Sidney, Non sono un angelo (1933), as one of Mae West's earnest pursuers, the classic La morte in vacanza (1934), (again with Fredric March), the Will Rogers vehicles David Harum (1934) and The County Chairman (1935), and Ramona (1936), (directed by his old friend, Henry King), top-lining Loretta Young and Don Ameche.Taylor then starred in a modest succession of ""B"" programs with Love in a Bungalow (1937), Pirates of the Skies (1939), Repent at Leisure (1941), Mississippi Gambler (1942), Alaska, inferno dell'oro (1944), The Crimson Key (1947) and The Sickle or the Cross (1949) which, at the very least, kept him busy and in the public eye. More noticeable during this period was his portrayal of Doc Holiday in Tombstone: The Town Too Tough to Die (1942), opposite Richard Dix's Wyatt Earp.With his film career on the decline, Taylor turned more and more to TV, becoming the medium's Le inchieste di Boston Blackie (1951) for a couple of seasons, a role that followed in the popular footsteps of Chester Morris, (who starred in an earlier series of Boston Blackie films as the urbane master thief-cum-detective), followed with a lead in the series The Rough Riders (1958). Taylor was a frequent visitor on the sets of popular western series, including Zorro (1957), Laramie (1959), The Rifleman (1958) and Rango (1967). Toward the end of his career, however, the elderly actor took a bizarre John Carradine-like turn into Grade ""Z"" projects. Some of them--including horror movies like La mano strisciante (1963), Terrore sull'isola dell'amore (1968), Satan's Sadists (1969), Smashing il racket del crimine (1970), Blood of Ghastly Horror (1967) and Girls for Rent (1974)--achieved cult infamy as some of Hollywood's most notorious ""turkeys.""

He first studied drama at Ohio's Wilmington College before transferring to Florida A&M in Tallahassee, Florida.Gaining experience back at an Indianapolis radio station as a State House political correspondent and in repertory theater. His first professional break came in with a national tour of the musical ""Hair."" He eventually became a member of both Chicago's Goodman Theatre and the Organic Theatre group. One of his stage performances, ""Sizwe Banzi Is Dead,"" earned him Chicago theater's Joseph Jefferson Award. Taylor transported himself to Los Angeles in the 78 and found minor work in a few of the popular horror films of the day: La maledizione di Damien (1978), L'ululato (1981) and The Beast Within (1982), and also started to make the typical rounds on popular TV shows including ""Barney Miller,"" ""Lou Grant"" and ""M*A*S*H.""After a regular part on the promising, but short-lived Buffalo Bill (1983), he nabbed the Emmy-nominated role of Anthony Bouvier, the jailbird-turned-assistant to Delta Burke, Annie Potts, Jean Smart and Dixie Carter. Originally a guest part at the beginning, he proved popular with audiences and the show progressed his character and was eventually made a full partner of the ladies' designer firm.Following this success, Taylor moved straight into four seasons with the sitcom Dave's World (1993) as a poker-playing buddy/neighbor to Harry Anderson. His film and TV load has been fairly lightweight overall with routine turns in such comedy fare as Mannequin (1987) and Class Act (1992), an Olsen twins mini-movie, and as a regular panelist on a revamped version of To Tell the Truth (2000). One of his brighter moments (literally) was playing the role of Lumiere in Broadway's ""Beauty and the Beast.""His later career was comprised of lowbudget comedy films such as Jacks or Better (2000), Friends and Family (2001), Club Fiji (2008), as well as horror/drama including Tranced (2010), Wigger (2010) and Hyenas (2011).

He had one child from his first marriage. In addition to daughters Tamar, Yasmine and Esme and son Tariq, he has a sister, Judith, and brother, Hussain, a private investigator in the Los Angeles area, as well as four grandchildren.

nm0852965,Noah Taylor,Noah Taylor,173,"Noah George Taylor, the elder of two boys, was born in 1969 in London, England, to Maggie (Miller), a journalist and book editor, and Paul Taylor, a copywriter and journalist. His family lived in both England and New Zealand before returning to his parents' native Australia in 1974. His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his father remarried--to theatre publicist, Suzie Howie. Noah left home at age 16 before graduating from University High School in Melbourne when he fell into acting. He decided to pursue his craft at St. Martin's Youth Theater. Despite his intense studies, the remote, slim-framed actor did not make his professional theater debut until March 1997 with Chekhov's ""The Seagull.""His work at St. Martin's led to an auspicious debut playing the painfully shy and sensitive teen Danny Embling in the coming-of-age film The Year My Voice Broke (1987). This affecting performance lost none of its heart-tugging appeal when the sequel Flirting (1991) came out four years later. Noah won awards for both films. Unconventionally typecast as the gawky, gloomy-eyed, somewhat manic depressive, directors started lining up to use the young actor. It all culminated in what is arguably the best known performance of his career--as the young, tortured genius, pianist David Helfgott, in Shine (1996). Working in tandem with Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush, who played Helfgott as an older adult, Noah's scenes with Armin Mueller-Stahl, who played the pianist's egregiously abusive father, were incredibly powerful and helped him to win the Film Critics Circle of Australia and Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival awards. The variety of Noah's performances have been stunning over the years. He played a young Adolf Hitler in the drama Max (2002), a ""what-if"" spin on Hitler growing up as an angry tortured artist instead of a Fascist dictator following World War I. He played the darkly humorous protagonist in E morì con un felafel in mano (2001) and the titular Jewish outcast in Simon Magus (1999).Music, songwriting and art have been other strong passions for Noah. In 1994 he became part of a band called ""The Honky Tonk Angels. A singer-guitarist, included in this band were Noah's co-stars from previous movies Loene Carmen and Kym Wilson. He has also formed other bands with such names as Cardboard Box Man, Flipper & Humphrey and The Thirteens, a country-western rock group.American audiences have taken an equal ""shine"" to Noah recently, particularly as the manager of Stillwater in the popular film Quasi famosi (2000); as Bryce in the popular adventure film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and its sequel which both starring Angelina Jolie; a featured role in Vanilla Sky (2001) which starred Tom Cruise; and in the ""Willy Wonka"" extravaganza La fabbrica di cioccolato (2005) as Mr. Bucket.","September 4, 1969 in London, England, UK",1969-09-04,"London, England, UK",,,,,Dionne Harris  (14 November 2012 - present),1,0,0,0

nm0853028,Ray Taylor,Raymond Edgar Taylor,,"One of the more prolific American directors, Ray Taylor was a Midwesterner who began his show-business career as an actor and stage manager in regional theater, a career that was interrupted by army service in World War I. After his discharge he ventured to Hollywood, where he got a job with Fox Films and worked as an assistant director, often with John Ford. In the 1920s Taylor traveled crosstown to Universal Pictures, where he got the opportunity to become a director, initially of one- and two-reelers. His proficiency in that niche impressed Universal execs enough to promote him to features and serials. When talkies made their debut, Taylor--unlike many of his silent-era colleagues--had no trouble adapting to the techniques of sound films, and in fact his career went on the fast track. Universal put him in the director's chair on many of its top western series and eventually placed him at the helm of one of its most popular and fondly remembered serials, ""Flash Gordon."" However, due to a worsening drinking problem his work by the late 1930s and early 1940s was often erratic. Director William Witney said he got his first co-directing credit--on the Republic serial The Painted Stallion (1937)--because Taylor had gotten so drunk by lunchtime one day about halfway through filming that he had to be taken home. Witney was called upon to replace him and finish the picture.Taylor was teamed up with the equally prolific, but more reliable, Ford Beebe during his last years at Universal. When the serial genre began to die out Taylor went back to making westerns, and was eventually hired by Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC) to try to give a professional veneer to its low-grade western series starring erstwhile ""cowboy"" Lash La Rue. When the series and its star left low-rent PRC for Ron Ormond's even lower-rent Western Adventure Productions, Taylor went with them. However, the series' rock-bottom budgets, tenth-rate scripts and the stupefying ineptness of its star stymied whatever efforts Taylor made to breathe some life into them, and these entries can hardly be counted among his better efforts. Taylor retired from the business in 1949 and died in 1952.","December 1, 1888 in Perham, Minnesota, USA",1888-12-01,"Perham, Minnesota, USA","February 15, 1952 in Hollywood, California, USA",1952-02-15,"Hollywood, California, USA",,,0,0,0,0

Born on August 22, 1960, she was raised in Oklahoma where she became acutely aware of racial bias while attending a newly integrated school in Muskogee. She went on to study at Southern Methodist University and graduated in 1981, subsequently moving to New York. She made her professional acting debut in the CBS made-for-TV movie Negro Go Home (1981).On Broadway Taylor became the first Black woman to play William Shakespeare's Juliet thanks to the non-traditional casting efforts of Joseph Papp. She also played Cecilia in ""As You Like It"" and the First Witch in ""Macbeth"" during the same season. Other on- and off-Broadway work included ""Machinal,"" ""A Map of the World,"" ""The Illusion,"" and ""Jar the Floor."" On the West Coast, she won an L.A. Dramalogue award for her work in ""The Tempest."" Making her film debut with Conta su di me (1989), she became known for her quiet intensity and human dignity in both social drama and the more popular action-oriented films such as Lontano da Isaiah (1995), Clockers (1995), Spirit Lost (1996), and Il negoziatore (1998).Taylor furthered her career on TV as well in such series as Law & Order - I due volti della giustizia (1990) and earned notice for her portrayal of Anita Hill opposite Delroy Lindo's Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in the made-for-TV movie Strange Justice (1999). She was particularly moving in her portrayal of another maid in the superlative period piece Cora Unashamed (2000), co-starring the equally versatile Cherry Jones. After her success in ""I'll Fly Away,"" she moved into other series such as Feds (1997) and The Education of Max Bickford (2001), but these did not fare as well with audiences.As a playwright Taylor has won the American Critics' Association new play award for ""Oo-Bla-Dee,"" which detailed the story of Black female jazz musicians of the 1940s. ""Drowning Crow"" was an adaption of Anton Chekhov's ""The Seagull,"" which made it to Broadway in 2004. Others works include ""A Night in Tunisia,"" ""Escape from Paradise,"" ""Watermelon Rinds,"" and ""Inside the Belly of the Beast."" She conceived and appeared in the 2001 one-woman play ""Millennium Mambo,"" which included selections of works from various African American female writers.

Taylor is also a Woodrow Wilson fellow and widely published award winning poet (American Academy of Poets Prize) whose first collection, Florida East Coast Champion, was published by Rolling Stone Press to wide critical acclaim. Renowned English poet and critic Thom Gunn of Berkeley wrote, ""Rod Taylor is simply the best poet to turn up in the last fifteen years...."" Publisher's Weekly proclaimed, ""This is a man who writes like an angel."" And National Book Award winning poet, novelist and critic James Dickey (Deliverance) enthusiastically endorsed Rod's work commenting that ""Taylor is going to be the salvation of all of us in American Poetry. I will read anything he writes with that growing excitement one is privileged to feel only in the presence of genuine talent."" Taylor has given readings of his work at many universities and colleges including Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA, San Francisco State, Harvard, NYU, University of Florida, University of Mo., University of Texas and many others.While still at Stanford Taylor moonlighted as a singer in a rock band, becoming a prolific songwriter as well, and writing material for several well known Bay Area rock bands. As his music gained recognition Rod became the object of a bidding war between Columbia's Clive Davis and the legendary David Geffen, with whom he signed his first record contract, thus beginning a music career that produced seven albums, principally under the name Roderick Falconer, as he was first known in the U.K. Collaborating with some of the top talent in the world of rock, Rod's peak musical output spanned more than two decades, continuing well into the period of his immersion in the motion picture and television industry. Many of Taylor's songs have been covered by other artists such as Tricia Yearwood, Jose Feliciano, Linda Ronstadt and other well known artists in the U.S. and Europe. In recent years much of Rod's musical contribution has been in the area of film and television as both a composer and recording artist. Most recently Rod performed his music on the soundtrack of the Warner Brothers television series, Witchblade. His recordings are currently available on iTunes and most other leading internet music sites.In television and film Taylor has written and produced in a wide array of genres, creating network series and writing both independent and studio feature films and television movies.

Taylor,Stanner Edward Varley Taylor,,"Stanner Edward Varley Taylor (1874-1948) was a newspaper man who borrowed a typewriter at the New York Herald to write plays, while the rest of the city slept. His plays impressed the owner of the American Mutoscope & Biography Co. and in 1908 he was hired to write stories for the new moving pictures. The next two years Taylor wrote 85% of their pictures including, D.W. Griffith's first film The Adventures of Dollie (1908), the first movie filmed in Hollywood, In Old California (1910), the first interfaith romance A Child of the Ghetto (1910).Taylor married his leading lady, Marion Leonard, and left Biograph to start their own studio. It was reported that Ms. Leonard's salary was $1,000 per week at a time when no one had heard of Mary Pickford. In 1912 they founded The Monopol Film Company. Taylor expanded to writing, directing and producing and made over 100 films before retiring in 1926. As a silent film pioneer, he was the first director to receive on screen credit (1910), the first screenwriter to work on retainer, the first producer to be pictured in a film advertisement (1913), and his 1913 production of Carmen contained 426 scenes. S.E.V. Taylor created the first quadruple exposure in-camera visual effects shot in Monopol's The Dead Secret (1913) with Marion Leonard playing a dual role.","September 28, 1877 in St. Louis, Missouri, USA",1877-09-28,"St. Louis, Missouri, USA","November 23, 1948 in Los Angeles, California, USA",1948-11-23,"Los Angeles, California, USA",,Marion Leonard  (1909 - 23 November 1948) (his death),1,0,0,0

He looked like - and was - a certified public accountant, graduate from Northeastern University. A struggling actor in his youth, he worked in stock, tent shows and on radio. After army service in World War II, he became a prolific performer in early anthology series on television (eg. Kraft Television Theatre (1947) and Robert Montgomery Presents (1950)), though he continued to alternate these with appearances on the New York stage. He was also glimpsed in movies, invariably in small supporting roles, most notably as Deacon Davis in La gatta sul tetto che scotta (1958), and as George Lowery, boss to doomed Janet Leigh in Psyco (1960).Vaughn reserved his best for the small screen, where he showed his versatility in genial or waspish roles, often as doctors, judges and bankers. He was capable of portraying benevolence as easily as taking on the mantle of greedy or corrupt attorneys, or second-string grifters (his repertoire even included vicious real-life gangster, George 'Pa' Barker, in an episode of Gli intoccabili (1959)). Among his numerous TV credits, his five journeys into Ai confini della realtà (1959) stand out in particular.Severe spinal deterioration brought about Vaughn's retirement from acting in 1976.

nm0853375,Leigh Taylor-Young,Leigh Taylor,175,"Leigh Taylor-Young was born in Washington, DC, to a diplomat father and raised in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, the older sister of future actress Dey Young and writer/director Lance Young. She studied classical ballet and, following high school, attended Northwestern University where she initially majored in economics. She switched gears after developing an interest in theater and apprenticed as the youngest member of the distinguished Eaglesmere Summer Repertory Theatre. Leigh eventually moved to New York with designs on a professional career and studied under acting guru Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Her major break came when she was cast in the already popular prime-time soap Peyton Place (1964). She played the mysterious Rachael Welles, whose character was brought in to provide clues to the disappearance of Allison MacKenzie's (Mia Farrow, who had shocked ardent viewers by abruptly leaving the series). A mysterious girl herself, Leigh had a fetching figure, slightly offbeat beauty and a tendency to be cast as unsympathetic characters. She developed a bit of bad publicity when she walked off the weekly series after only one season and into the arms of the very popular--and very married--series star Ryan O'Neal. The couple married in 1967, following his divorce from actress Joanna Moore, and had one child, Patrick O'Neal.Leigh started off in films auspiciously as a ""flower child"" of the psychedelic 1960s. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for ""Best Newcomer"", when she played opposite Peter Sellers, in the eccentric comedy, Lasciami baciare la farfalla (1968), but then appeared opposite her husband in Io sono perversa (1969), a kinky flop that landed with a big thud. She went on to appear in a cameo in her husband's British-made movie, I formidabili (1970), then her career sputtered again with a series of misguided features, including the star-heavy but critically lambasted epic, L'ultimo avventuriero (1970); the kinky British film, The Buttercup Chain (1970), which dealt with kissing cousins who don't quite stop at kissing; the beautifully photographed but rather hollow action-adventure, Cavalieri selvaggi (1971), co-starring Omar Sharif; and the so-so romp, La gang che non sapeva sparare (1971), which is best remembered for starting Robert De Niro off and running in films. Leigh's best known role came, alongside Charlton Heston, in the controversial 2022: i sopravvissuti (1973), although she was a bit overshadowed by the grisly topic material and the showy performances of co-stars Heston and Edward G. Robinson.Following her divorce from O'Neal in 1973, Leigh made herself somewhat scarce while raising her young son. In 1978, she married agent/director Guy McElwaine, but that marriage would also end in divorce. In the 1980s, she made a comeback of sorts as a mature--but still spicy--and taunting character actress. Although she took a back seat to Albert Finney in the thriller, Troppo belle per vivere (1981), and to Glenn Close and Jeff Bridges in the whodunit, Doppio taglio (1985), she found her best results back on TV, again. She nabbed an Emmy award in 1994 for her vixenish supporting role on the acclaimed series drama, La famiglia Brock (1992). In addition, she performed in several plays, in the US, England and Scotland, including ""The Beckett Plays"", ""Knives"" and ""Sleeping Dogs"". More recently, she appeared in her writer/director brother Lance Young's film, Al di là del desiderio (1997). These days, Leigh plays a regular role on the daytime soap, Passions (1999).Leigh also found a fulfilling life off-camera. She became an ordained minister in the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, and her voice can be heard in the Search of Serenity series of audio meditations from The Course in Miracles trainings. She is also the grandmother of two granddaughters from her son Patrick O'Neal's relationship with Rebecca De Mornay.","January 25, 1945 in Washington, District of Columbia, USA",1945-01-25,"Washington, District of Columbia, USA",,,,,"John Morton  (1 January 2013 - present)

Her father, Melvin Lester Taymor, was a gynecologist. Her mother, Elizabeth Bernstein, was a teacher of political science. Young Taymor was fond of international folklore and mythology, and also developed a passion for theatre. She spent her formative years living in several countries. As a teenager, during the 1960s, she lived in Sri Lanka and India with the Experiment in International Living program, then studied acting in Paris, at the mime school of Jacques Lecoq. From 1969 to 1974, she studied theatre and mythology at Oberlin College, graduating in 1974 with a degree in folklore and mythology.During the 1970s, Taymor lived in Japan, studying the art of puppetry and Japanese theatre. Then, she spent five years in Indonesia, working as director of international theatre with Asian, European, and American actors. Back in the USA, she worked on and off Broadway. There, she achieved her first success with staging a fairy tale, ""The King Stag"", and then toured 66 cities across the world, including Los Angeles, Venice, Tokyo, and Moscow.In the 1990s, Taymor directed several classic operas. Her 1992 production of Igor Stravinsky's ""Oedipus Rex"" in Japan earned the Emmy Award. Then, she directed the 1993 production of ""The Magic Flute"" by 'Wolfgang Mozart', in Florence, with conductor Zubin Mehta, and the acclaimed 1994 production of ""Salome"" in St. Petersburg, Russia, with conductor Valery Gergiev.In New York, she continued a stellar theatrical career, directing such productions as William Shakespeare's ""Titus Andronicus"" and ""Juan Darién: A Carnival Mass"" at the Lincoln Center. In 1997, Taymor directed a massive Walt Disney Company's production of ""The Lion King"" on Broadway, for which she also co-designed over a 100 costumes and masks of animals, and earned two Tony Awards.Her film, Frida (2002), received six Oscar nominations, and two Oscars, for make-up and for the music score by Elliot Goldenthal. Taymor continued her success with the 2004 production of ""The Magic Flute"" at the Metropolitan Opera (which is now in repertoires at the Met), and the 2006 staging of ""Grendel"" at the Los Angeles Opera and, later, at the Linolcn Center Festival. Taymor's experience with cross-genre and cross-cultural productions came to culmination in her latest film, Across the Universe (2007). It is a musical set in the 1960s England, Vietnam, and America, where a love story and social protest are intertwined with over thirty songs by The Beatles.Outside of her directing profession, Taymor amassed puppets, masks and folk art from around the world. As an artist, she has been involved in making puppets, masks, costumes and stage sets. Since 1980, Julie Taymor has been a long-time collaborator with the Oscar-winning composer, Elliot Goldenthal, and the couple lives in Manhattan.","December 15, 1952 in Newton, Massachusetts, USA",1952-12-15,"Newton, Massachusetts, USA",,,,,Elliot Goldenthal  (? - present),1,0,0,0

She began dancing at the age of three, and by the time she was seven she was showing marks of brilliance. At eleven she made her professional debut and trained at the school of the Paris Opera. In 1940 she joined Serge Lifar's Monte Carlo Ballet, becoming the youngest prima ballerina in the history of dance, under the pseudonym of ""Tcherzina."" Chief among her performances there was her Juliet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1942). She was 21 when offered her first film role, in The Lover's Return (1946) with French star Louis Jouvet. In 1948 she made her British film bow with the stylized fairy tale classic The Red Shoes (1948) and went on to perform gloriously in The Tales of Hoffman (1951). Both of these films also featured her husband and frequent dance partner, Edmond Audran. Shortly after the filming of Hoffman, Audran was tragically killed in a road accident. The grief-stricken Tcherina went into seclusion but was persuaded to return to her art form in 1953 by second husband Raymond Roi, who remained her husband until her death in 2004. It was her film work in Hoffmann that perked up the eyes and ears of Hollywood. She made her American debut in Sign of the Pagan (1954), in which she performed a straight dramatic role along with an interpretative dance. This marked her first departure from classical ballet.

Conway Tearle was born in New York City on May 17, 1878 to a family of entertainers. Christened Frederick Conway Levy, his father, Jules, was a jazz musician, and mother Marianne Conway, an American actress. Divorced when Conway was quite young, his mother subsequently married British Shakespearean actor/theatre manager Osmond Tearle and Conway was raised in England from the age of 10.Tearle gained experience on his stepfather's stage and was alternately billed as ""Frederick Levy"" and ""Frederick Conway"" before settling on the marquee name of Conway Tearle. Having returned to the U.S. in 1905, he made his Broadway debut with ""Abigail"" that same year and would make a name for himself as a reliable romancer for nearly a decade before attempting films in 1914. His two half brothers, Godfrey Tearle and Malcolm Tearle would also become actors on both the stage and screen.Tearle's more famous films are deemed ""women's pictures,"" where he appeared meticulously as a dashing hero or ardent lover. Among his more notable were Helene of the North (1915) opposite Marguerite Clark, The Foolish Virgin (1916) and The Common Law (1916) both starring Clara Kimball Young, Stella Maris (1918) with Mary Pickford, A Virtuous Vamp (1919) with Constance Talmadge, She Loves and Lies (1920) and The Eternal Flame (1922), both opposite Norma Talmadge, Amore di domani (1924) featuring Corinne Griffith, and Dancing Mothers (1926) starring Clara Bow. Conway made a smooth transition into sound pictures and remained a leading star or prime support in ""B"" level pictures.Tearle ended his film career spurned by Mae West in Annie del Klondike (1936) and with a lesser role in the lavish production Giulietta e Romeo (1936) starring Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard. In 1937 he appeared in his final stage lead with the comedy ""Hey, Diddle Diddle."" Headed for a Broadway run, the show had to close early in Washington, D.C. because of Tearle's poor health.

nm0853607,Godfrey Tearle,Godfrey Seymour Tearle,,"Godfrey Seymour Tearle was born in 1884, the son of British actor/manager George (Osmond) Tearle and American actress Marianne Conway (her second marriage). His father and uncle were first-generation acting Tearles, and his mother also came from a family of actors. It seems that Godfrey's destiny was set at birth. The Tearles' family's origins lay rooted in the rural areas of Bedfordshire. His grandfather was a soldier who served in the Crimean War. Godfrey made his stage debut at age nine as young Prince Richard, Duke of York, in his father's production of ""Richard III."" He subsequently attended Carlisle Grammar School in Carlisle, England, but continued acting in his father's company into his teen years. His older half-brother, Frederick (Levy), was also a successful actor and later billed himself as Conway Tearle and earned distinction as a suave silent-era matinée idol. In 1908 Godfrey made his film debut in a shortened version of Romeo and Juliet (1908), at the Lyceum Theatre, which co-starred then-wife actress Mary Malone. Building up his stage reputation in the classics, he became a Shakespearean player of note with sterling portrayals of ""Othello"", ""Macbeth"" and ""Henry V"", among others. Active service in the Royal Field Artillery in 1915 temporarily interrupted his budding theater career for nearly four years. He returned to the footlights, but also attempted to earn a reputation in silents. Although he was less successful, Godfrey's mellifluous voice proved ideal for sound and he made a mild go of it with occasional movie forays in the 1930s and 1940s. He distinguished himself as patrician gents in both character leads and supports. He made a particular impression in Il club dei 39 (1935), Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller, in which he played the professor (aka menacing agent) minus a finger; La morte è discesa a Hiroshima (1947) as President Franklin D. Roosevelt; Mandy (1952), a four-tissue tearjerker, as the grandfather of a deaf child; and the charming comedy The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953) as a genial bishop, which was released the year of his death. On the personal front, he and actress Malone were divorced after 20 years of marriage, and Godfrey married much-younger starlet Stella Freeman in 1932. Tragically she died aged 26 in May 1936 from pneumonia, just a few months after the suicide of his actor/brother Malcolm Tearle. A third marriage failed for but he managed to enjoy the last few years of his life in the company of Stratford stage actress Jill Bennett.

nm0853636,Renata Tebaldi,Renata Ersilia Clotilde Tebaldi,178,"Renata Tebaldi was and is surely one of the best Spinto soprano voices that any century has ever heard. She made her operatic debut, through bombed streets in 1944 in Mefistofele, as Elena. Then was hand picked for the reopening of La Scala, 46 by Toscanini. It was there that the legendary ""Voice of an Angel"" started. He put Tebaldi upon a podium, well above the choir, and said ""I want your voice to sound as though an angel is coming from Heaven."" That is how it all started.Her career began to grow at the same time as Maria Callas, though, actually, if one delves into their respective careers, they were so different, performing only three or four roles at the same time. In 1950 Tebaldi was selected by both esteemed conductors, Toscanini and De Sabata, for their versions of the Verdi Requium. These recordings exist today, and one can see how her vocal splendor was soon to become an international phenomenon. Her operatic debut in the United States, was AIDA in '50 in SF. She was booked just opon hearing a few of her recordings.Tebaldi was so lucky, as she began her career just as the recording industry was beginning to record complete operas on LP. Decca/London quickly signed this promising new talent, and she continued to record for the label until 1974. She often recorded her repertoire twice, one in mono, then in Stereo, as her vocal and dramatic prowess only increased with time. Her legendary Decca recordings are mostly still in print, Aida, La Boheme, Madama Butterfly, La Fanciulla del West, Otello (in which she was unsurpassed as Desdemona), Andrea Chenier, Adrianna, La Wally, La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut, and Tosca. These are all available, on many labels, as live recordings as well.Tebaldi's operatic career took one's breath away, just looking at the theatres she performed in, The Met, War Memorial, Covent Garden, San Carlos, Paris, Russia, Chicago Lyric, to name only a very few.Her complete operas on video only give testament to her greatness, her absolutely gorgeous voice. Tosca '61 Stuttgart is now on DVD, along with her Andrea Chenier, with the wonderful and her recording partner, Mario del Monaco, Japan '61, Forza del Destino '58 with Corelli and Bastianini is also on DVD.Her voice has been praised by Beverly Sills, Martina Arroyo, Joan Sutherland, and the great Caballe, who saw her as a youngster, and wanted to be like her. Also the many tenors who worked with her, Del Monaco, Di Stefano, Bjorling, Morell, and Richard Tucker, always praised her in every way possible. So did Franco Corelli, whom, both tall and good-looking, often left audiences spellbound, with their looks and singing.To this day, she still is in great health, and loves to hear from her fans. She does consider them as family, as she feels she sacrificed a family for a career, way before it was acceptable for a woman to do so. But her fan base only grows. All you have to do is put on just one track of a Tebaldi CD, or record, to know why.","February 1, 1922 in Pesaro, Marche, Italy",1922-02-01,"Pesaro, Marche, Italy","December 19, 2004 in San Marino  (undisclosed)",2004-12-19,San Marino  ,undisclosed,,0,0,0,0

He once spent a month in a Russian prison after being caught selling birth-control pamphlets.After roaming about in the Brazilian jungles and working as a stoker on a French freighter, Tellegen got into a scrape involving a lady that landed him once more in prison - this time in Paris. He sent a telegram to his friend, actor Édouard de Max, who obtained his release from prison and introduced him to Sarah Bernhardt. She hired him as her leading man and he accompanied her on tour. Tellegen starred as Lord Essex opposite Bernhardt in 1912's Les amours de la reine Élisabeth (1912). He went on to enjoy a brief career as a matinee hero in silent films and married opera star Geraldine Farrar.

Whether it's been touring theatre or filming, he loves how his work allows him to see such different places, experience different cultures and meet so many different people - it's even got him performing for Her Majesty the Queen at Buckingham Palace.Andrew has performed on stage in London and at almost all of the major UK theatres as well as performing open air productions at the mercy of the British weather. Acting and presenting for the screen makes up a large part of his work, whether it is film, TV, commercial or corporate. This is mostly recorded inside so the weather can then do what it likes!Andrew also works as a voiceover artist - from commercial to promos, from narrative to comedy, from continuity to animation and from hard sell to character voices - his range and ear for accents make him an ideal audio casting choice.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Like Mr. Aldrich, DeNucci also hails from Cranston, Rhode Island, USA. If DeNucci's career thus far is any indication, the young Director and Actor will be a worthy successor to Mr. Aldrich's legacy and a prominent voice for his own generation.For DeNucci's Almost Mercy (2015), Scott Hallam of dreadcentral.com proclaims: ""DeNucci holds nothing back on this one. Almost Mercy confronts major social issues and does so in a way that's delicate, but also quite powerful, and deals them into a revenge-thriller that's actually empowering for the viewer.""DeNucci plays a member of boxer Vinny Pazienza's entourage in Bleed for This (2016), which stars Miles Teller (Whiplash) as Pazienza and Aaron Eckheart (Erin Brokovich) as ""Paz's"" trainer. Directed by Ben Younger and executive produced by Martin Scorsese.In action films, Tom and Ultimate Fighting legend Chuck Liddell wreak havoc as ruthless mercenaries in Altitude (2016), a film that stars Dolph Lundgren (Drago from Rocky IV) and Denise Richards (Wild Things). In Blue Line (2015), DeNucci plays a drug dealer on the edge, under siege from a hard as nails cop played by Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan).As versatile as he is prolific, DeNucci's resume also includes forays into family films. As Director, his Arlo the Burping Pig (2016) tells the story of a lonely, young girl and the adorable teacup pig she adopts as a pet. Tom lends his acting talents to Christmas All Over Again (2016) as Francisco, a wild wedding planner.Ringing in 2017 Tommy directed The Santa Files (2017) telling the story of a group of kids from Norpole, Maine and their search for Santa Clause. Now slated for 2018, Vault, is his next film following the story of a famous Providence heist in the 1970's.Imagine Magazine named Tom DeNucci as its 2015 Shooting Star Award Recipient.

He's also made episodic appearances in Brad Pitt's PLAN B ENTERTAINMENT-produced ""Monsters of God"" (Garrett Dillahunt, Lauren Ambrose [TNT pilot]), NBC'S ""The Night Shift"" (LOST's Ken Leung), Robert Rodriguez's ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" (Zane Holtz, Wilmer Valderrama) on his EL REY network, and EPIX'S ""Graves"" (Nick Nolte, GLOW's Chris Lowell). In addition, Chris has totaled over two hundred other roles, as well as producing or directing over sixty independent narrative works.Chris was born on February 25th in Topeka, KS, where he was also raised. His father moved from the West Coast to the Midwest and started his own business, which he's run successfully for forty years. His mother got her degree in education and raised a family over a twenty year range. His paternal grandparents immigrated from Holland to the United States, while his maternal grandparents made their home in many small towns throughout the Midwest.While working as an editor for a Fortune 500 company, Chris discovered the indie film & commercial scene in Kansas City, and received a part in the first film he auditioned for. When he wasn't acting & learning on set, he was studying the craft and as many details as possible of each crew position. In just two and a half years he'd brought characters to life in over twenty films & been involved behind the scenes in nearly every possible facet in at least that many more, before resigning his job and moving to pursue acting full-time.By the time another three years had passed, he had appeared in nearly one hundred twenty-five films (features or shorts), TV shows, webisodes, and commercials all over the country; over twenty of which won awards, including Regional Emmys and four individual Best Acting awards. He'd also worked behind the camera as director, producer, editor, and in casting - winning seven awards for films directed, and receiving the 2014 Emerging Filmmaker Award from the Kansas City Film Fest.This culminated in more career moves, & the goal of joining the episodic storytelling movement. The following years saw him quickly turn SAG-AFTRA and add seven episodic roles to his resume, before expanding his big-budget feature horizons with D'Onofrio's directorial debut THE KID, & joining the Breaking Bad universe in EL CAMINO, as SEAN LIEBOLD.His passion for bringing roles to life with authenticity and empathy is only rivaled by his extreme work ethic, as he continues to refine his art and craft intriguing characters from his home base in LA.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm3857479,Kelsey Zukowski,Kelsey Alyse Zukowski,165,"Kelsey Zukowski is an experienced and passionate screenwriter, actress, and model, specializing in the horror genre through dark examination. Based in Los Angeles, she has worked on productions across the country, working heavily in the indie horror scene in Chicago as well as LA. Zukowski is most well-known for penning and co-starring in the surreal dark drama, ""What They Say"", winning awards at film festivals across the country. More recently her tale of real life horrors of bullying and abuse in the psychological slasher, ""Words Like Knives"", premiered at Blood at the Beach festival in Virginia Beach. Zukowski is working on the feature haunted house film, ""Within These Walls"", a gritty collaboration with filmmaker James Tucker, centering on a disturbing ghost story that brings out complete entrapment and relentless torment of one girl as she struggles to find her inner-strength (played by Zukowski).Zukowski is a huge believer in all that the horror genre is capable of. She strives to dive in to the good and the bad, the light and darkness, that surrounds us, in a creative, justifying sense through the genre. She eagerly ventures in to other genres, but her home is in horror. Zukowski was heavily inspired at an early age by the Halloween franchise, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and fellow Cleveland-native, Wes Craven's surreal and 'fighting through the mind' brand of horror in particular.Zukowski has a background in theater, having fallen in love with acting during a school production when she was 10. This love of acting proved to be a love of storytelling and the cinema in particular. When Zukowski was 14 she began writing film reviews, greatly inspired by the late Roger Ebert's writing style and ability to relay the entire movie going experience in his reviews. While still in high school in Ohio, Zukowski's film reviews were being published in the California-based newspaper, The Valley Voice. She has been a published film critic for the past 7 years writing for a variety of websites including Criticsword.com, HorrorYearbook.com, FilmArcade.net, DirectorsLive.com, TheCelebrityCafe.com, and 8th-circuit.com. She's written TV recaps, music and movie reviews, news stories, and has conducted interviews with independent film makers around the world. She has covered and shown appreciation for all types of films from low budget independent to Hollywood mainstream and always eager to highlight foreign films or unknown gems.Zukowski has a Bachelors of Arts in Digital Cinema with a concentration in Screenwriting from DePaul University. Shortly after graduating, Zukowski became involved with the independent film scene. Some of her earliest roles were in various productions of crime writer, Kevin Jamison's intense serial killer depictions, the throwback horror anthology ""Psycho Street"", and the Autumn Offering ""Born Dead"" music video, which aired on MTV2's Head Banger's Ball. From acting she bridged in to modeling, working heavily with alternative, pin-up, and glamor modeling. As in her writing, Zukowski is most drawn to thematic, stylistic modeling that has an artistic expression, human emotion, and creates a singular world within an image.","November 13, 1988",1988-11-13,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Moussi began his martial arts training in the art of jujutsu under Canadian martial arts legend John Therien and also trained in kickboxing under legendary kickboxing champion Jean-Yves Theriault. He had trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Carlos Machado, eventually earning his black belt in the art. Moussi got his start as a stuntman and credits Jean Frenette, a former world martial arts champion turned stunt coordinator for films, with giving him his start. His first job was doubling Henry Cavill in the film Immortals. He has doubled for Travis Fimmel in Warcraft, Hugh Jackman in X-Men: Apocalypse, and Jai Courtney in Suicide Squad.At the Cannes Film Festival in 2014, it was announced he would get his first lead role in a reboot of the 1989 film Kickboxer, which starred Jean-Claude Van Damme. In Kickboxer: Vengeance, Moussi played Kurt Sloane, a young martial artist who must refine his skills to avenge his brother's death. Van Damme himself replaced the departing Tony Jaa as Kurt's teacher, now named Master Durand. The film received mixed reviews but the confidence of the film resulted in two sequels, Kickboxer: Retaliation, released in 2017, and Kickboxer: Syndicate, which began production in February 2017. The sequels bring Moussi back as Kurt Sloane and in addition, Moussi and longtime friend Jean-Francois LaChappelle served as fight choreographers of Retaliation.Moussi also played the role of Charlie Nash in the web series sequel Street Fighter: Resurrection.","March 29, 1981 in Libreville, Gabon",1981-03-29,"Libreville, Gabon",,,,,Janie Des Rosiers  (4 April 2012 - present),1,0,0,0

nm3874849,Petar Strugar,Petar Strugar,187,"Petar was born in Cetinje in Montenegro, because Budva doesn't have maternity hospital of its own. His father, Vladimir, is a former volleyball coach and his mother, Dragana, was an accountant. Petar grew up on Adriatic coast, in Budva, where he went to elementary school ""Stefan Mitrov Ljubisa"". Later he enrolled into high school ""JUSMS Danilo Kis"", wanting to become a seaman or professional volleyball player when he grows up. While attending high school he got a job as a drummer in a local marching band and as an actor and skit writer in a local TV teenage series named ""Cool"". Thanks to this Petar enrolled into his high-school drama section. All the while he trained for a professional volleyball player.After he graduated high school, his drama teacher begged him to try to enroll into Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Cetinje. But the time was short, only five days till entrance exam, so Peter decided to go for Maritime Faculty in Kotor, department of Nautics. But thespian demons didn't leave Petar alone, so the next day he went to Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Cetinje, and though he didn't learn his lines nor what he was supposed to do the professors panel recognized his talent and accepted him.He began his studies in drama, but while attending his third year he was offered a role in a motion picture that would be shot in Belgrade. Peter went on a casting that turned into a month of traveling back and forth from Cetinje to Belgrade, while simultaneously preparing a stage play in Cetinje. So he would travel to Belgrade by night, on a train, do casting, and then return to Cetinje during the day and went on rehearsals.One of the requirements for him to get the motion picture role was that he would have to learn how to play football and master the Serbian accent. So he froze his studies in Montenegro and moved to Belgrade full time.After perfecting the two Petar got the role of Blagoje ""Mosa"" Marjanovic in Dragan Bjelogrlic's ""Montevideo: Taste of a Dream"" (2010), for which he got an award. He played the same role in sequel ""See You in Montevideo"" (2014). The part of Mosa launched young Petar to stardom. After finishing the two ""Montevideo"" movies and eponymous TV series, Strugar guest starred in local TV series. But cinema audiences wanted more of the young actor. He got the lead role in hit comedy ""Little Buddho"" (2014) for which he mastered a rhoticism and got an extra weight of 20 kg (about 40 pounds).Next year he got the role of underground fighter Vladica, in action-comedy ""The Samurai in Autumn"" (2016) for which he turned the extra weight into muscles. The movie was not as well received as Strugar's previous feature, but everyone praised his transformation and talent. Sometime later Petar got a recurring role on Croatian soap ""Prava zena"" and a cameo in Nikola Kojo's ""Stado"" (2016).Now he resides in Belgrade, where he's preparing to become a member of an international stunt team as an actor-stuntman.","May 23, 1988 in Cetinje, Montenegro, Yugoslavia",1988-05-23,"Cetinje, Montenegro, Yugoslavia",,,,,Ivana Nikolic  (November 2013 - 2015) (divorced) (1 child),1,1,1,1

While taking an acting class, a fellow classmate told him that Warner Brothers was looking for fresh young faces to star in the Todd Phillips produced Project X and that Cooper would be perfect. With no representation, Oliver enlisted his friend, a former child star, Shaun Weiss, to help him secure an audition. Judd Apatow, who had worked with Weiss on Heavyweights, put in a call to the casting office. With a head shot taken on a cell phone camera, and against-all-odds, Cooper landed one of the lead roles in his very first audition. His debut performance as Costa earned him two MTV Movie Award nominations for Best Comedic Performance and Best On-Screen Dirtbag.Following up on the success of Project X, Oliver booked a supporting role in Runner Runner opposite Justin Timberlake and Ben Affleck as well as a season arc on the popular Showtime series Californication as Levon, the illegitimate son of David Duchovny and Heather Graham's characters.In 2013 Cooper co-wrote and produced Four Dogs with his frequent collaborator Joe Burke who also directed the film. It premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival to rave reviews and is available to stream on Amazon Prime. Shortly thereafter he developed a pilot for Comedy Central called The King of Chicago, which he co-wrote with Cody Oz and produced alongside Scott Stuber.Oliver has since gone on to star in many shows and movies highlighted by his role as Wheeler, the stoner with a heart of gold, in the three season Amazon series Red Oaks, produced by Steven Soderbergh and directed by David Gordon Green.

Creatively inspired by the German Expressionistic mind of Tim Burton, Mitchel began spinning short stories of his own and developing stop motion animation films on an old VHS camcorder, and with that his love for the process of film was discovered. Amidst perfecting his wicked skateboarding skills, incredible talents for guitar and music creation, his teen years focused his writing efforts into horror screenplays. After high school Mitchel attempted to major in film at the University of Toledo only to discover the curriculum a joke and his skills far beyond the general techniques of the hobbyist students around him. Bored with this, he branched out on his own choosing to spend his tuition money on film equipment... This allowed him to work on several short film projects before setting out on his own to shoot his first short film project with another student entitled ""The Pilfer"". The short was well received and unique for it's time.Having spent a decent amount thus far, Mitchel felt it only wise to put his camera to work for him and began shooting for the country/southern rock group Sierra Shame. Months of bar scenes and line dancing had earned him cash but not much for film experience so when he was offered the opportunity to work with the History channel on a Halloween special for the show Modern Marvels he was more then ecstatic. Now bitten by the production bug he took this as inspiration to start his own production company Chasing Autumn Films, LLC and has teamed up with TRIWAR Pictures, LLC.In the spring of 2010 he began working with the Shad Ireland foundation that is raising awareness about the causes of kidney disease in under privileged communities.

He attended a local Catholic School for his early education and throughout his early teens he wrote and staged many plays forming the first theatre group in the school. Despite being a below average student in academics, he got accolades from the teachers for his penchant for writing and also served as the Editor of School Magazine for 2 years. His exceptional theatrical skills earned him a seat at one of the most prestigious Film Schools in India but he was unable to pursue it due to family commitments. He subsequently settled for his average skills in science and started pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Engineering. Even during those Engineering years, his flame for creativity did not douse and he insistently struggled to give a new face to the College Theatre Group giving it a name that won honors in major University Theatre Competitions. He made his first short feature music video with a group of friends which inspired many students across India and earned him appreciation. He started his professional career as a Software Consultant for an MNC and moved to Kochi located in the Southern part of India which is drastically different from the rest of the country in terms of language, culture and food. Even though he was so far from his dream city and dream job, he did not let his determination falter. He played role as a Cinematographer for a Short Film shot in regional language there. After a struggle of one year he finally got transferred to Mumbai, the heart of Theatre and Cinema. While continuing his work at Wipro, he took his first step into the industry with the help of a Film Caterer in Film City. It was just a meager job of dropping Beta tapes for Edit. He worked during the day and did night shifts for a TV shoot. Since he did not have any relevant background in the field, he took up any kind of work to gain learning experience. These varied experiences have given him the unusual feat of working with cast, crew and film of all major Indian languages as First Assistant Director, Casting Director, Editor, Screenwriter, Line Producer, Executive Producer, Distributor and Director. It was the desire to learn in any possible way that got him involved in covering the 26/11 Terrorist Attack on the Taj single handedly for an Israeli News Channel. Due to widespread nepotism and lobbying in the industry he finally left working for corporate structures and started a Line Production Company Creative Roots India to help promote Independent Cinema in Mumbai. The company helps students from major universities abroad to make their Foreign Diploma Films in India. His venture Cinematically Correct promotes first time Film makers and produces several Short Featurettes in Mumbai. He is associating with Independent Film makers in Line Producing films throughout India thus promoting Indian Independent Film culture by helping them reach International audience and Inviting Foreign Independent projects to come shoot in India. His next goal is setting up an NGO called 'Free Spirit Foundation' to help bring out the creativity in the group of people who do not have access to the expensive technology thus giving them an opportunity for a career choice they would otherwise not be able to make.",,,,,,,,Maulshree Gangwar  (1 January 2011 - 13 July 2016) (divorced),1,1,0,0

Often collaborating alongside lifelong friend Andrew Bennett under the moniker The Versa Brothers-his work with Bennett focuses extensively on truth-seeking.Stevenson's influences stem heavily from the frenetic dialogue of Aaron Sorkin and the world-building, history, and mythology of Ridley Scott, George Lucas, and Damon Lindelof. Important tropes involved in Stevenson's work involve the solemnity of the passage of time, the loyalty that binds family and friends, the relativity of socio-political opinions, the reverence of the elderly, and the struggle of displaced transcendentalists. Stevenson frequently draws from themes present in punk / alternative rock music and Libertarianism (Counter-Culturalism, Self-Reliance, and Desire for Rebellion) to express his frustrations with extremist ideologies.In June of 2018, Stevenson's series Cerebral was recognized at SeriesFest as one of 13 official selections internationally in the Drama category. He has worked for Time Warner, SONY and been the recipient of various local film festival awards. His first feature film out of college was distributed internationally and led to his eventual introduction to television with a series he directed called Rapture-featuring Lew Temple (The Endless, The Walking Dead) and Rob Pralgo (The Vampire Diaries).

He took the name 'Michael' from his father and granddad and 'Douglas' from his other granddad who died twelve years before he was born.As a young child, Ryan loved films and would repeatedly watch The Lion King, The Mask and surprisingly after much pleading, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.His first experience of acting was in primary school when he played a dragon. He was repeatedly told to be quiet at home for practicing his roar because his parents had no idea that he was just rehearsing for an upcoming part. During secondary school, Ryan was more interested in sports than performing, captaining his school football and cricket teams. It was only in his final year that he got involved with the annual school play.At 16, Ryan began studying Performing Arts at Wiltshire College, Trowbridge but dropped out at 18, just three months before finishing his second year because he started auditioning for various projects and wanted to focus on acting work. He worked on a couple feature films and short films before making the move to London in 2012 on the day of the Olympics opening ceremony. Shortly after arriving in London, he booked his first TV commercial for the UK Home Office and MTV working on an abuse awareness campaign to help prevent abuse in teenage relationships. He then went on to shoot campaigns for various brands including Proximus, Snickers, Popchips and Tog 24.To make money in between acting jobs, he would sometimes take random jobs abroad to satisfy his need for adventure and indulge in the different experiences life has to offer. One of these jobs took him to Finland for five weeks as an activity guide driving elves and families to various locations, creating fires in the snow and leading snowmobile excursions through the forest. Another job took him to France for six weeks to work on the horse team in the small north-central village of Fontaine-Le-Port.","March 18, 1992 in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England, UK",1992-03-18,"Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England, UK",,,,,,0,0,0,0

He is much appreciated for the experimentation and multifariousness of his productions.Since his childhood Boodee was passionately involved in drawing comics which gradually persuaded him to explore the arenas of painting, fashion designing and visual arts. He moved into the field of music in the late 80s as the lead singer of the band, Boo-Dee and the Woo-Zees. He has also been writing columns for newspapers every now and then.After working with a local theatre group in Colombo, he joined the School of Visual arts in New York City to study film and television in 1987. Boodee graduated in 1995 presenting Veils of Maya (Sihina Deshayen) as his thesis, which was to win 31 awards later in several film festivals. Most remarkably, seven of the awards were presented to Boodee including the Best Film and the Best Director.During his time in New York City he met his friend Stephen Farber who introduced Boodee to Looking Glass Studios, in which he was consequently employed. The two friends collaborated with late Allen Ginsberg, Philip Glass and John Moran to a documentary on Late 20th Century Opera Composers. Boodee directed the documentary and co-produced it with Faber.Returning to Sri Lanka, he has been directing and co-writing a string of diverse and experimental cinematic productions since, also contributing to numerous tv series and documentaries, redefining the Sri Lankan domains of these fields.As much as he introduced an experimental arena to Sri Lankan cinema in 1996 with Veils of Maya, he ushered in a unique acting style which was natural and realistic through Buongiorno Italia (Mille Soya) in 2004. Heralded as a fresh new approach to Sri Lankan cinema, it was also identified as a part of an international wave of neo-realism by critics such as Amy Taubin.He contributed as the director and visual effects supervisor to the feature film Matha in 2009. The film has won eight awards including the best cinematography and visual effects in two different film festivals. Boodee is also a two time SIGNIS award winner as a best director.

Soon after, her second rise to fame came when she starred in two consecutive films with the late actor Ahmed Zaki, where she played the role of the deceived, classy wife in the film Nazwa (1996) and an innocent daughter of a corrupt wealthy man in Hassan El Lol (1997). Wanting to diversify and avoid being type-cast as the elegant, delicate girl, Shereen waited for the right role: in 2008 the role of a police officer soon became hers in the movie Ashraf Harami. She appeared as a guest star in the medical drama series Lahazat Hariga (Critical Moments) and in the sitcom Ragel Wa Sit Sittaat (A Man and Six Women). She took part in several television series for three consecutive years, such as Al Safa'a (The Slap), Bidoun Zikr Asmaa (Without Mentioning Any Names) and Al Morafaa (The Plea). Playing the character of Deja, the mysterious tattoo artist, Shereen returned to the silver screen in the film The Blue Elephant (2014), which was one of the most successful films of that year in Egypt. However in 2015, she surprised everyone with her powerful and deep performance in the film Out of Order, playing a widow who spends her life watching the world around her go up in flames, then enters into an odd relationship with a young man who leads a life close to that of a homeless man, and with whom she slowly slides into the world of drug abuse. Her performance in Out of Order brought her wide critical acclaim and won her the Best Actress award at the 42nd Egyptian Cinema Film Association Festival. Not only was this role a huge departure from her usual typecast roles of the classy woman, but the challenge of playing this character gave her a deeper understanding and a personal and artistic maturity in her work, something she wishes to use in her future projects, which would be a mix of experimental and diverse roles that would aid in discovering her hidden potential as an actress. This was obvious in her role in Photocopy film for which she won the Best Actress in a Leading Role award at the Egyptian Cinema Film Association Festival. Reda played another new and distinctive character in the film Al Deif (The Guest). She played Mimi, wife of an author and thinker who arouses controversy through his writings. Playing memorable roles each year, Reda is always keen on appearing in Ramadan TV series, including El Ahd (2015), Foq Mostawa El Shobohat (2016), La Totfea' Al Shams (2017), and Bani Youssef (2018). Reda also starred in Hagar Gohanam TV series, which was aired in 2017.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Although cast in many independent films, Brown still considers herself aspiring because she feels that with acting (as with anything in life) one should always look to grow and learn more. And that is what she is doing.Coming late into the field, Brown feels she has been blessed with many life experiences that have prepared her for each and every character she has and will be cast in. She has played the gamut of characters that include an action fighter (Crisis Function and Crisis Function Awakening - still filming), a detective investigating corruption (Wages of Sin: Special Tactics - still filming), a jury member trying not to be swayed by her fellow jurors (12 Angry Women - still filming), a woman who discovers her boyfriend has been cheating on her (Pieces of David) and even a mother pushed to the edge (A Woman And A Gun)!But Brown has yet to accomplish her goal: Showing the world that a Type One Diabetic (T1D) can and will accomplish anything they desire and change the perception of diabetics in this industry. After almost 17 years as a T1D, Brown has overcome so much with her diabetes especially regaining the ability to walk after fighting diabetic nerve damage in her legs and feet almost nine years ago. And now, Brown wears her diabetes each and every day. Literally! She has an insulin pump and for some productions, the thought of having an actress with such a visible device for treatment has been a bit unnerving. But in the past few years, Brown has seen a change in which production companies are writing her character in as a diabetic who is strong and determined OR they allow the pump to be worn and shown without feeling the need to address it because it does not take away from Brown's ability to deliver the character.It is a slow change but it is one Brown is excited about accomplishing!

nm4039514,Bill Freas,William Jacob Freas III,175,"Born January 25, 1979 in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Bill began his work in the arts and entertainment industry at a young age. During his youth, he studied creative writing with renowned author and screenwriter S.C. Sykes. A state champion musician during his time as a student at Wissahickon High School in Ambler, Pennsylvania, Bill also performed professionally in the Philadelphia area with such dynamic, eclectic ensembles as The City Rhythm Orchestra/Big Band (bass trombone), The Black Eyed Peas Jazz Band (tuba), The Philadelphia Sinfonia II (tuba), The United States Army Reserve Bands (bass trombone), Purple Sunset (piano, keyboards, drums), and indie pop-rock band Marah (tuba).While at WHS, he won numerous music awards, including the prestigious John Philip Sousa Award, and earned top positions in major ensembles, including sweeping first-chair tuba distinctions in PMEA District 11 Band and Orchestra, Region 6 Band and Orchestra, and Pennsylvania All-State Band, all in his senior year. Over four years at WHS, he earned tuba seats in a total of eight PMEA band and orchestra festivals, as well as being chosen in back-to-back years as the bass trombonist for the elite Cavalcade All-Star Jazz Band. As his musical interests peaked, Bill studied intensive music theory and composition while learning to play every instrument. Following graduation from WHS in 1997, Bill continued his musical studies at West Chester University in West Chester, Pennsylvania, while maintaining his professional career as a performer, composer, and arranger.In 2000, Bill was hired to compose the musical score and theme for a Philadelphia-based television pilot produced by Ron Smolin for Fat Hat Films, Inc. That opportunity branched out to positions as head writer and cast member for the project, which garnered interest from networks such as TBS and Comedy Central. Following his involvement with the project, Bill began writing for film full-time and soon secured numerous deals for his projects with various international film companies. Over the next few years, he expanded his technical, business, and creative capabilities and began producing, directing, and acting as well. In 2011, Bill's first major directorial debut ""Ain't So Funny"", which he also wrote and produced, made its world premiere at the popular Blue Snowman Film Festival in Montreal, Quebec to rave reviews. In addition to writing for film, he has authored a satirical comedy book, an eclectic horror and sci-fi short story collection, and a number of acclaimed fiction works that have been published by several domestic literary entities in top-selling anthologies and literary compilations.Founded in 2010, Bill's production company, Crazy Owl Films, has worked in various development and production capacities on a number of film and television projects both in-house and outside of the company. The firm frequently partners with Canadian film label Foresight Entertainment to produce genre films such as ""Friends in Dark Places"", ""Nocturne Six"", and ""Shadow Hill"". In 2014, Crazy Owl Films expanded and opened a music division known as Crazy Owl Entertainment that composes and produces original music for established professional musical artists and for placement in film, television, and assorted multimedia projects. Bill's alma mater, Wissahickon High School, honored his school and career achievements by inducting him into its Hall of Fame in 2017.","January 25, 1979 in Norristown, Pennsylvania, USA",1979-01-25,"Norristown, Pennsylvania, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm4043618,Tom Holland,Thomas Stanley Holland,173,"Thomas Stanley Holland was born in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, to Nicola Elizabeth (Frost), a photographer, and Dominic Holland (Dominic Anthony Holland), who is a comedian and author. His paternal grandparents were from the Isle of Man and Ireland, respectively. He lives with his parents and three younger brothers - Paddy and twins Sam and Harry. Tom attended Donhead Prep School. Then, after a successful eleven plus exam, he became a pupil at Wimbledon College. Having successfully completed his GCSEs, in September 2012 Tom started a two-year course in the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology notable for its numerous famous alumni.Holland began dancing at a hip hop class at Nifty Feet Dance School in Wimbledon, London. His potential was spotted by choreographer Lynne Page (who was an Associate to Peter Darling, choreographer of Billy Elliot and Billy Elliot the Musical) when he performed with his dance school as part of the Richmond Dance Festival 2006. After eight auditions and subsequent two years of training, on 28 June 2008 Tom made his West End debut in Billy Elliot the Musical as Michael, Billy's best friend. He gave his first performance in the title role of Billy on 8 September 2008 getting rave reviews praising his versatile acting and dancing skills.In September 2008 Tom (together with co-star Tanner Pflueger) appeared on the news programme on channel FIVE and gave his first TV interview. In 2009 Tom was featured on ITV1 show ""The Feel Good Factor"". At the launch show on 31 January he and two other Billy Elliots, Tanner Pflueger and Layton Williams, performed a specially choreographered version of Angry Dance from Billy Elliot the Musical, after which Tom was interviewed by host Myleene Klass. Then he became involved into training five ordinary British schoolboys learning to get fit and preparing their dance routine (fronted by Tom) for the final ""The Feel Good Factor"" show on 28 March 2009. On 11 March 2010, Tom, along with fellow Billy Elliots Dean-Charles Chapman and Fox Jackson-Keen appeared on The Alan Titchmarsh Show on ITV1.On 8 March 2010, to mark the fifth anniversary of Billy Elliot the Musical, four current Billy Elliots, including Tom Holland, were invited to 10 Downing Street to meet the Prime Minister Gordon Brown. It was Tom Holland who was chosen to be a lead at the special fifth anniversary show on 31 March 2010. Elton John, Billy Elliot the Musical composer, who was at the audience, called Tom's performance ""astonishing"" and said that he was ""blown away"" by it. Holland had been appearing on a regular basis as Billy in Billy Elliot the Musical rotating with three other performers till 29 May 2010 when he finished his run in the musical.In two months after leaving Billy Elliot the Musical, Holland successfully auditioned for a starring role in the film The Impossible (directed by Juan Antonio Bayona) alongside Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. The Impossible was based on a true story that took place during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012, and was released in Europe in October 2012, and in North America in December 2012.Tom has received universal praise for his performance, in particular: ""What a debut, too, from Tom Holland as the eldest of their three lads"" (The Telegraph); ""Tom Holland, making one of the finest feature debuts in years"" (HeyUGuys); ""the excellent Tom Holland"" (The Guardian); ""The child performers are uncanny and there is an especially terrific performance from Tom Holland as the resourceful, levelheaded Lucas terrified but tenacious in the face of an unspeakable ordeal"" (Screen Daily); ""Young Holland in particular is astonishingly good as the terrified but courageous Lucas."" (The Hollywood Reporter); ""However, the real acting standout in The Impossible is the performance of Tom Holland as the eldest son Lucas. His portrayal is genuine, and at no moment does it feel melodramatic and forced. The majority of his scenes are separate from the lead actors and for the most part it feels like The Impossible is Holland's film"" (Entertainment Maven); ""Mr. Holland, meanwhile, matures before our eyes, navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility. He is a terrific young actor"" (New York Times).Tom has given a number of interviews about his role in The Impossible. In particular, he talked on video to Vanity Fair Senior West Coast editor Krista Smith and with IAMROGUE's Managing Editor Jami Philbrick. He has also given interviews to The Hollywood Reporter, to the MovieWeb, to Today Show on NBC and to other outlets. Tom's director and co-stars have also talked about him. Juan Antonio Bayona: ""He had this extraordinary ability to get into the emotion and portray it in a very, very easy way. The best I'd ever seen in a kid."" Ewan McGregor: ""It was wonderful watching Tom who had never worked in front of a camera before, to see him really get it and grow as a film actor as he went along. He's really talented and polite to everyone. It's very easy for children to lose perspective but he's absolutely on the right road and a brilliant actor."" Naomi Watts: ""He has an incredible emotional instrument and an unbelievable sense of himself... Tom Holland and I had a couple of moments where we came together and I could just tell how wonderful he was and what a beautiful instrument he had. It was just easy to work with him, that was one of the greatest highlights for me: discovering a friendship with Tom off-screen and this beautiful relationship between mother and son on-screen. The intimacy that develops through the course of the film between Lucas and Maria, I just loved that relationship. I mean, Tom is a beyond gifted actor. He's just a raw, open talent that is just so easy to work with. And Tom, he's inspiring, he kind of lifts everyone's game around him because he can do nothing but tell the truth. He was great.""In his turn, Tom Holland has returned favours to Naomi Watts when he was asked to present Desert Palm Achievement Award to her at Palm Springs International Film Festival. According to HitFix: ""One recurring theme of the night was how the introductions were often better than actual winner's speeches... The best intro, however, had to go to 16-year-old Tom Holland who intro'd his ""Impossible"" co-star Watts. Holland admitted of all of Watts' great performances his dad had only let him see ""King Kong"" and while they spent six weeks shooting in a water tank he didn't know it was ""difficult"" because he actually ""loved it""... Most important, this was Holland's first film role and he sweetly noted, ""From the moment I met you, you took my hand and you never let go."" Cue the ""awwww"" from the audience."" The presentation is available on video.In 2011, Holland was cast in British version of the animation film Arrietty, produced by Japan's cult Studio Ghibli. He has provided voice over for the principal character Sho. In 2012 Tom Holland played the starring role of Isaac in the film ""How I lived Now"", (directed by Kevin Macdonald) alongside Saoirse Ronan. The film was released in 2013.On 17 October 2012, Holland became a recipient of Hollywood Spotlight Award for his role in The Impossible. ""We are very excited that we will be able to recognize acting talents that are on the road to discovery and stardom,"" said Carlos de Abreu, founder and executive director of the Hollywood Film Awards in a statement. On 6 December 2012 it was announced that Holland became a winner of the National Board of Review award in the ""Breakthrough Actor"" category. In the end of December 2012, Holland was voted a winner for the year's Best Youth Performance in Nevada Critics Awards.In December 2012, Holland received a number of nominations for his role in The Impossible: for the 18th annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards, in the ""Best Young Acror/Acress"" category; for Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the ""Most Promising Performer"" category; for the 27th Goya Awards in the ""Best New Actor"" category; for the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the ""Best Youth Performance"" category; for the London Film Critics Circle Awards 2012 in the ""Young British Performer of the Year"" category.Kristopher Tapley, Editor-at-Large of HitFix, reported on 27 August 2012 that Summit Entertainment, the company responsible for distribution of The Impossible in USA, would be campaigning Holland rather than McGregor as the lead, and strongly argued that Tom Holland deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Actor category. The fact of long-listing for an Academy Award was confirmed in the article in the Hollywood Reporter: ""And though McGregor stars as his father in the film, Holland has been submitted as the lead actor for awards consideration. Regardless if he receives any nominations, his performance as the strong-willed and determined eldest son is garnering critical acclaim.""As one of the most promising young actors, Holland was featured in Screen International's ""UK Stars of Tomorrow - 2012"" and in Variety's ""Youth Impact Report 2012"". Holland has been signed up by William Morris Endeavor (WME) global talent agency and is represented by Curtis Brown literary and talent agency.In 2015, Tom was cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in Sony and Marvel's films. He has played the role in Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018).","June 1, 1996 in Kingston upon Thames, England, UK",1996-06-01,"Kingston upon Thames, England, UK",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm4043796,Ansel Faraj,Ansel Faraj,,"Ansel Faraj is an award-winning independent director, screenwriter, and producer.An LA kid growing up minutes from Venice Beach - he decided at the age of 6 to be a film director, and has thus spent the past 21 years working steadily toward that goal. With no connections to the film industry, he spent his formative years studying the films screened on Turner Classic Movies; and watching Dark Shadows reruns on SciFi Channel, which instilled in him a great love of the occult and the macabre. He is a fully self taught filmmaker - making his own productions - first on mini-VHS tapes with his Universal Monsters action figures, and later with friends from school, learning and honing his craft with each production.Supported by his family and a talented repertory company of actors, he has directed eight feature films and countless short subjects, operating on a budget of chewing gum, shoestring, and sheer determination.He first gained attention with his revisionist Doctor Mabuse films, the first of which premiered in limited theatrical release in May 2013, with its follow up feature releasing the following year.In 2014, he wrote and directed a 6-part anthology series Theatre Fantastique, featuring Sally Kirkland, Christopher Pennock, Lisa Blake Richards, Jerry Lacy, and Lara Parker. In 2017, he directed a second season - the complete series was later released to DVD by Alpha New Cinema. The series introduced eccentric characters such as the Murderous Mahones and Madame LaSoeur.In 2015, his Lovecraft Noir feature film The Last Case of August T. Harrison, starring Jerry Lacy and Nathan Wilson, made the rounds at film festivals across the country.Between 2015-2017, he worked on The Detective Adam Sera Chronicles, a comic book style serial based upon characters Faraj invented in high school (and explored in an earlier student film trilogy in 2010 with character actor Linden Chiles.) The series takes place in the alternative ""Lost Angeles"" and followed the fantastical misadventures of disturbed Detective Adam Sera and his friend and superior Lt. Craig Hargroves and the gallery of rogues they face in their dark world.In 2018, his film, Will & Liz: a love story in Venice Beach, starring Nathan Wilson (who co wrote the film with Faraj) and Christine Tucker - was released on Amazon Prime Video.His latest film is Loon Lake, a psychological thriller starring Nathan Wilson and David Selby, shot on location in Minnesota.He intends to explore the worlds of Detective Adam Sera, Madame LaSoeur and Doctor Mabuse in future films. His dream project is his eventual own cinematic adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera, based upon the Gothic novel by Gaston Leroux.","November 22, 1991 in Los Angeles, California, USA",1991-11-22,"Los Angeles, California, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

Listening to hip-hop, and specifically its use of static in music, prompted Ben's first forays into manipulating sound. By high school, Ben had become a fixture around the station, which earned him an invitation from JP-Chill to try his hand at some on-air mixes. He was sold.He continued his sonic explorations at the California Institute of the Arts, where he studied synthesis, signal processing, acoustics, music theory, and composition, and earned a bachelor's degree in music technology. While at CalArts, Ben also delved into world music, studying Balinese gamelan, African drumming and hand percussion. Ben's multi-layered musical sensibility combines hip-hop, electronic, world music and classical composition.In 2007, Ben collaborated with composer Joby Talbot on the score to Wayne McGregor's ballet, Genus, based on Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, commissioned by the Paris Opera Ballet.

She is best known for her roles as Maritza Ramos on the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black and Lina on Jane the Virgin. Among her other roles was a recurring role on Are We There Yet? Guerrero grew up in Boston and remained there after the rest of her family was deported to Colombia. She is an advocate for immigration reform. Her role on Orange Is the New Black has twice contributed to wins for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.Guerrero was born in New Jersey to Colombian parents and raised in Boston, Massachusetts. As the only member of her immediate family with United States citizenship (by virtue of being born in the country), she remained in the U.S. when her parents and older brother were deported back to Colombia when she was 14. Her parents had pursued legal citizenship, but had been fraudulently represented. Guerrero's niece, who also grew up without a strong family support system, later served time in jail.Guerrero was raised in the Jamaica Plain and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston after being taken in by other Colombian families. She has had an interest in acting since a young age and took advantage of free opportunities in the neighborhood or at school. Then she attended Boston Arts Academy, a performing arts high school, where she was in the music department. Among her high school activities was singing with a jazz group, but she anticipated pursuing political science and communications in college. In 2010, she appeared in the Faces music video that was shot in Norwood, Massachusetts for Louie Bello. Her first job after college was in a law office. At age 24, she decided to pursue a career in acting. In 2011, she moved to New York City and studied acting at the Susan Batson Studios where she met her manager Josh Taylor. Guerrero's life experience compels her to advocate for immigration reform and is an influence that she draws upon in her acting.She auditioned for a role on Devious Maids, but was cast in Orange is the New Black, where she plays a Bronx-bred character that is likely Puerto Rican. For season 2, she was part of the cast that earned recognition for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. The cast earned recognition for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series again at the 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards. She has had a recurring role on Are We There Yet?.In 2014, she appeared in Emoticon ;), a comedy about a May-December romance in which her character's father is involved with a doctoral candidate. Her performance in this film as Amanda (""Mandy"") Nevins, an adopted teenage child, elicited positive criticism such as a description of a ""well-drawn smaller moment"" that was ""beautifully rendered"" according to Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter and a performance that ""command sympathy"" according to Inkoo Kang of the Los Angeles Times.One of her upcoming roles is as an 1800s Cuban confederate spy, loosely based on the life of Loreta Janeta Velazquez, for Peter and John. She was cast in The CW's series Jane the Virgin in a recurring role. In February 2015, Guerrero was cast as the female lead in CBS' television pilot for Super Clyde, but the show was not picked up for series when CBS announced its fall schedule in May. Guerrero has upcoming film roles in Happy Yummy Chicken, Beyond Control and The Godmother.In 2016, Guerrero released In the Country We Love: My Family Divided a memoir about her parents being detained and deported when she was fourteen.
